<p>When I was a boy in Norway during the 1960s, the world I grew up in was
delimited by the Cold War. It split families, towns, regions, and
countries. It spread fear and not a little confusion: Could you be
certain that the nuclear catastrophe would not happen tomorrow? What
could set it off? The Communists---a tiny group in my
hometown---suffered the suspicions of others for having different points
of view, and perhaps---it was said often enough---different loyalties,
not to our own country, but to the Soviet Union. In a place that had
been occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, the latter was a
serious matter: It implied betrayal, in a region that was wary of
treason. My country bordered the Soviet Union in the north and at the
slightest increase in the temperature of international affairs, tension
also mounted along the mostly frozen river where the frontier was set.
Even in tranquil Norway the world was divided, and it is sometimes hard
to remember how intense its conflicts were.</p>
<p>The Cold War was a confrontation between capitalism and socialism that
peaked in the years between 1945 and 1989, although its origins go much
further back in time and its consequences can still be felt today. In
its prime the Cold War constituted an international system, in the sense
that the world's leading powers all based their foreign policies on some
relationship to it. The contending thoughts and ideas contained in it
dominated most domestic discourses. Even at the height of confrontation,
however, the Cold War---although predominant---was not the only game in
town; the late twentieth century saw many important historical
developments that were neither created by the Cold War nor determined by
it. The Cold War did not decide everything, but it influenced most
things, and often for the worse: The confrontation helped cement a world
dominated by Superpowers, a world in which might and violence---or the
threat of violence---were the yardsticks of international relations, and
where beliefs tended toward the absolute: Only one's own system was
good. The other system was inherently evil.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-2}Much of the legacy of the Cold War centers
on these kinds of absolutes. At their worst they can be seen in the
American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: the moral certainties, the
eschewal of dialog, the faith in purely military solutions. But they can
also be found in the doctrinaire belief in free market messages or the
top-down approach to social ills or generational problems. Some regimes
still claim authoritarian forms of legitimacy that go back to the Cold
War: China is the biggest example, of course, and North Korea the most
dreadful one, but dozens of countries, from Vietnam and Cuba to Morocco
and Malaysia, have significant elements of the Cold War built into their
systems of government. Many regions of the world still live with
environmental threats, social divides, or ethnic conflicts stimulated by
the last great international system. Some critics claim that the concept
of never-ending economic growth, which may in the longer run threaten
human welfare or even the survival of humanity, was---in its modern
form---a creation of Cold War competitions.</p>
<p>To be fair to an international system (for once), there were also less
injurious aspects of the Cold War, or at least of the way the conflict
ended. Very few western Europeans or southeast Asians would have
preferred to live in the type of Communist states that were created in
eastern parts of their continental neighborhoods. And although the
legacy of US interventions in Asia is usually roundly condemned, a
majority of Europeans were and are convinced that the US military
presence within their own borders helped keep the peace and develop
democracies. The very fact that the Cold War confrontation between the
Superpowers ended peacefully was of course of supreme importance: With
enough nuclear weapons in existence to destroy the world several times
over, we all depended on moderation and wisdom to avoid an atomic
Armageddon. The Cold War may not have been the long peace that some
historians have seen it as
being.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en001en">^1^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en001} But at the
upper levels of the international system---between the United States and
the Soviet Union---war was avoided long enough for change to take place.
We all depended on that long postponement for survival.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-3}<strong>H[OW SPECIAL, THEN,]{.small-caps}</strong> was
the Cold War as an international system compared with other such systems
in history? Although most world orders tend to be multipolar---having
many different powers contending---there are some possible comparisons.
European politics between the 1550s and the early seventeenth century
were, for instance, deeply influenced by a bipolar rivalry between Spain
and England, which shared some of the characteristics of the Cold War.
Its origins were deeply ideological, with Spain's monarchs believing
they represented Catholicism, and the English, Protestantism. Each
formed alliances consisting of its ideological brethren, and wars took
place far from the imperial centers. Diplomacy and negotiations were
limited---each power regarded the other as its natural and given enemy.
The elites in both countries believed fervently in their cause, and that
the course of the centuries to come would depend on who won the contest.
The discovery of America and the advance of science in the century of
Kepler, Tycho Brahe, and Giordano Bruno made the stakes very high;
whoever came out on top would not only dominate the future, it was
believed, but would take possession of it for their purposes.</p>
<p>But apart from sixteenth-century Europe, eleventh-century China (the
conflict between the Song and Liao states), and, of course, the
much-explored rivalry between Athens and Sparta in Greek antiquity,
examples of bipolar systems are quite rare. Over time, most regions have
tended toward the multipolar or, though somewhat less commonly, the
unipolar. In Europe, for instance, multipolarity reigned in most epochs
after the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the late ninth century.
In eastern Asia, the Chinese empire was predominant from the Yuan
dynasty in the thirteenth century to the Qing dynasty in the nineteenth.
The relative lack of bipolar systems is probably not hard to explain.
Requiring some form of balance, they were more difficult to maintain
than either unipolar, empire-oriented systems or multipolar,
broad-spectrum ones. Bipolar systems were also in most cases dependent
on other states that were not immediately under the control of the
Superpowers but still bought into the system in some form, usually
through ideological identification. And in all cases except the Cold
War, they ended in cataclysmic warfare: the Thirty Years War, the
collapse of the Liao, the Peloponnesian War.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-4}There is no doubt that the fervor of the
confrontation of ideas contributed strongly to Cold War bipolarity. The
predominant ideology in the United States, emphasizing markets,
mobility, and mutability, was universalist and teleological, with the
built-in belief that all societies of European extraction were
necessarily moving in the same general direction as the United States.
From the very beginning, Communism---the special form of socialism
developed in the Soviet Union---was created as the antithesis of the
capitalist ideology that the United States represented: an alternative
future, so to say, that people everywhere could obtain for themselves.
Like many Americans, the Soviet leaders believed that "old" societies,
based on local identifications, social deference, and justification of
the past, were dead. The competition was for the society of the future,
and there were only two fully modern versions of it: the market, with
all its imperfections and injustices, and the plan, which was rational
and integrated. Soviet ideology made the state a machine acting for the
betterment of mankind, while most Americans resented centralized state
power and feared its consequences. The stage was set for an intense
competition, in which the stakes were seen to be no less than the
survival of the world.</p>
<p><strong>T[HIS BOOK ATTEMPTS]{.small-caps}</strong> to place the Cold War as a global
phenomenon within a hundred-year perspective. It begins in the 1890s,
with the first global capitalist crisis, the radicalization of the
European labor movement, and the expansion of the United States and
Russia as transcontinental empires. It ends around 1990, with the fall
of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the United
States finally emerging as a true global hegemon.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-5}In taking a hundred-year perspective on the
Cold War my purpose is not to subsume other seminal events---world wars,
colonial collapse, economic and technological change, environmental
degradation---into one neat framework. It is rather to understand how
the conflict between socialism and capitalism influenced and were
influenced by global developments on a grand scale. But it is also to
make sense of why one set of conflicts was repeated over and over again
throughout the century and why all other contestants for
power---material or ideological---had to relate to it. The Cold War grew
along the fault-lines of conflict, starting out in the late nineteenth
century, just as European modernity seemed to be reaching its peak.</p>
<p>My argument, if there is <em>one</em> argument in such a lengthy book, is that
the Cold War was born from the global transformations of the late
nineteenth century and was buried as a result of tremendously rapid
changes a hundred years later. Both as an ideological conflict and as an
international system it can therefore only be grasped in terms of
economic, social, and political change that is much broader and deeper
than the events created by the Cold War itself. Its main significance
may be understood in different ways. I have in an earlier book argued
that profound and often violent change in postcolonial Asia, Africa, and
Latin America was a main result of the Cold
War.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en002en">^2^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en002} But the
conflict also had other meanings. It can be constituted as a stage in
the advent of US global hegemony. It can be seen as the (slow) defeat of
the socialist Left, especially in the form espoused by Lenin. And it can
be portrayed as an acute and dangerous phase in international rivalries,
which grew on the disasters of two world wars and then was overtaken by
new global divides in the 1970s and '80s.</p>
<p>Whichever aspect of the Cold War one wants to emphasize, it is essential
to recognize the intensity of the economic, social, and technological
transformations within which the conflict took place. The hundred years
from the 1890s to the 1990s saw global markets being created (and
destroyed) at a dizzying pace. They witnessed the birth of technologies
that previous generations could only dream about, some of which were
used to increase mankind's capacity for the dominance and exploitation
of others. And they experienced a singularly quick change in global
patterns of living, with mobility and urbanization on the rise almost
everywhere. All forms of political thinking, Left and Right, were
influenced by the rapidity and voraciousness of these changes.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-6}In addition to the importance of ideologies,
technology was a main reason for the durability of the Cold War as an
international system. The decades after 1945 saw the buildup of such
large arsenals of nuclear weapons that---the irony is of course not lost
on the reader---in order to secure the world's future, both Superpowers
were preparing to destroy it. Nuclear arms were, as Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin liked to put it, "weapons of a new type": not battlefield
weapons, but weapons to obliterate whole cities, like the United States
had done with the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. But
only the two Superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union,
possessed enough nuclear weapons to threaten the globe with total
annihilation.</p>
<p>As always in history, the twentieth century saw a multitude of important
stories developing more or less in parallel. The conflict between
capitalism and socialism influenced almost all of these, including the
two world wars and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Toward the end of
the century, some of these developments contributed to making the Cold
War obsolete both as an international system and as a predominant
ideological conflict. It is therefore quite possible that the Cold War
will be reduced in significance by future historians, who from their
vantage point will attach more significance to the origins of Asian
economic power, or the beginning of space exploration, or the
eradication of smallpox. History is always an intricate web of meaning
and significance, in which the perspective of the historian writing it
is paramount. I am preoccupied with the part the Cold War played in
creating the world we know today. But this is of course not the same as
privileging the Cold War story over all other stories. It is simply to
say that for a long period of time the conflict between socialism and
capitalism profoundly influenced how people lived their lives and how
they thought about politics, both at a local and a global scale.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-7}Broadly speaking, the Cold War happened
within the context of two processes of deep change in international
politics. One was the emergence of new states, created more or less on
the pattern of European states of the nineteenth century. In 1900 there
were fewer than fifty independent states in the world, about half of
them in Latin America. Now there are close to two hundred, which mostly
share a remarkable degree of similarity in governance and
administration. The other fundamental change was the emergence of the
United States as the dominant global power. In 1900 the US defense
budget stood, converted to 2010 US dollars, at around \$10 billion, an
extraordinary increase over previous years, thanks to the
Spanish-American War and counterinsurgency operations in the Philippines
and Cuba. Today that expenditure has expanded 100 times, to \$1,000
billion. In 1870 US GDP was 9 percent of the world total; at the height
of the Cold War, in 1955, it was around 28 percent. Even today, after
years of reported US decline, it is around 22 percent. The Cold War was
therefore shaped in an era of state proliferation and rising US power,
both of which would help create the direction that the conflict took.</p>
<p>These international changes also ensured that the Cold War operated
within a framework in which nationalism was an enduring force. Although
believers in socialism or capitalism as social and economic systems
always seemed to deplore it, appeals to some form of national identity
could sometimes defeat the best-laid ideological plans for human
progress. Time and again grand schemes for modernization, alliances, or
transnational movements stumbled at the first hurdle laid by nationalism
or other forms of identity politics. Though nationalism---by
definition---also had its clear limitations as a global framework
(witness the defeat of the hypernationalistic states of Germany, Italy,
and Japan in World War II), it was always a challenge to those who
thought the future belonged to universalist ideologies.</p>
<p>Even at the height of the Cold War, from 1945 to 1989, bipolarity
therefore always had its limitations. In spite of their attractiveness
on a global scale, neither the Soviet nor the US system was ever fully
replicated elsewhere. Such cloning was probably not possible, even in
the minds of the most fervent ideologues. What resulted in terms of
societal development were either capitalist or socialist economies with
strong local influences. In some cases these blends were much resented
by political leaders, who wanted an unsullied form of their political
ideals put in place. But---fortunately for most, it could be
claimed---compromises had to be made. Countries like Poland or Vietnam
both subscribed to a Soviet ideal for development, but remained in fact
very different from the Soviet Union, just as Japan or West Germany---in
spite of profound US influence---stayed different from the United
States. A country like India, with its unique blend of parliamentary
democracy and detailed economic planning, was even further from any kind
of Cold War ideal type. In the eyes of their own leaders, and of their
strongest supporters elsewhere, only the two Superpowers remained pure,
as models to be emulated elsewhere.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-8}In a way this is not surprising. Concepts of
modernity in the United States and the Soviet Union had a common
starting point in the late nineteenth century and retained much in
common throughout the Cold War. Both originated in the expansion of
Europe, and of European modes of thinking, on a global scale over the
past three centuries. For the first time in human history, one
center---Europe and its offshoots---had dominated the world. The
Europeans had built empires that gradually took possession of most of
the globe, and settled three continents with their own people. This was
a unique development, which led some Europeans, and people with European
ancestry, to believe that they could take control of the whole world's
future through the ideas and technologies they had developed.</p>
<p>Even though this form of thinking had much deeper roots in history, its
apogee was in the nineteenth century. Again, this should be no surprise:
The nineteenth century was without doubt the era in which the Europeans'
advantage over all others culminated in terms of technology, production,
and military power. The confidence in and dedication to what some
historians have called "Enlightenment values"---reason, science,
progress, development, and civilization as a system---obviously sprang
from the European preponderance of power, as did the colonization of
Africa and of southeast Asia and the subjugation of China and most of
the Arab world. By the late nineteenth century Europe and its offshoots,
including Russia and the United States, ruled supreme, in spite of their
internal divisions, and so did the ideas they projected.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-9}Within the epoch of European predominance,
its ideas gradually germinated elsewhere. Modernity took on different
shapes in different parts of the world, but the hopes of local elites
for the creation of industrial civilizations of their own extended from
China and Japan to Iran and Brazil. Key to the modern transformation
that they hoped to emulate were the primacy of human willpower over
nature, the ability to mechanize production through new forms of energy,
and the creation of a nation-state with mass public participation.
Ironically, this spread of ideas that were European in origin signaled
the beginning of the end of the epoch of European predominance; peoples
elsewhere wanted modernity for themselves in order to better resist the
empires that lorded over them.</p>
<p>Even within the heart of European modernity ideological contests were
developing in the nineteenth century that, in the end, would blow the
whole artificial concept of one modernity apart. As industrial society
took hold, a number of critiques developed that questioned not so much
modernity itself, but rather its endpoint. There had to be more, some
claimed, to the remarkable transformation of production and society that
was going on than making a few people rich and a few European empires
expand in Africa and Asia. There had to be an aim that made up---at
least in historical terms---for the human misery created by the
processes of industrialization. Some of these critics linked up with
others who claimed to deplore industrialization altogether and sometimes
idealized pre-industrial societies. The dissenters demanded new
political and economic systems, based on the support of ordinary men and
women who were being thrown into capitalism's centrifuge.</p>
<p>The most fundamental of these critiques was socialism, a term that came
into popular use in the 1830s but has roots back to the French
Revolution. Its central ideas are public rather than private ownership
of property and resources and the expansion of mass democracy. To begin
with, quite a few socialists were looking back as much as forward. They
celebrated the egalitarianism of peasant communities or, in some cases,
the religious critique of capitalism, often connected with Christ's
Sermon on the Mount: "Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that
would borrow of thee turn not thou away."</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-10}But by the 1860s early socialist thought
was coming under pressure from the thinking of Karl Marx and his
followers. Marx, a German who wanted to organize socialist principles
into a fundamental critique of capitalism, was more preoccupied with the
future than the past. He postulated that socialism would grow naturally
out of the chaos of economic and social change in the mid-nineteenth
century. Neither the feudal order of old nor the capitalist order of the
present could handle the challenges of modern society, Marx thought.
They would have to be replaced by a socialist order based on scientific
principles for running the economy. Such an order would come into being
through a revolution by the proletariat, the industrial workers who had
no property of their own. "The proletariat," Marx said in his <em>Communist
Manifesto</em>, "will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all
capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of
production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the proletariat organized
as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as
rapidly as
possible."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en003en">^3^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en003}</p>
<p>Marx's adherents, who called themselves Communists after his
<em>Manifesto</em>, in the nineteenth century never constituted more than small
groups, but they had an influence far greater than their numbers. What
characterized them were to a large extent the intensity of their beliefs
and their fundamental internationalism. Where other working class
movements sought out gradual progress and stressed the economic demands
of the underprivileged they represented, Marx's followers stressed the
need for relentless class-struggle and for conquering political power
through revolution. They saw the workers as having no homeland and no
king. They saw the struggle for a new world as having no borders, while
most of their rivals were nationalist and, in some cases, imperialist.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-11}Their internationalism and antidemocratic
dogmatism were the main reasons why Marxists often lost out to other
working class movements toward the end of the nineteenth century. In
Marx's Germany, for instance, the setting up of a new strong unitary
state under Bismarck in the 1870s was welcomed by many workers, who saw
nation building as preferable to class-struggle. But Marx himself,
interviewed from his comfortable exile in London's Haverstock Hill,
condemned the new German state as "the establishment of military
despotism and the ruthless oppression of the productive
masses."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en004en">^4^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en004} When the
German Social Democrats in their 1891 program stressed the struggle for
democracy as the main political aim, they were also roundly condemned by
the Marxists. They had demanded "universal, equal, and direct suffrage
with secret ballot in all elections, for all
citizens."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en005en">^5^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en005}
Friedrich Engels, Marx's collaborator and successor, saw this as
"removing the fig-leaf from absolutism and becoming oneself a screen for
its nakedness." "This sacrifice of the future of the movement for its
present may be 'honestly' meant," Engels said, "but it is and remains
opportunism, and 'honest' opportunism is perhaps the most dangerous of
all."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en006en">^6^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en006}</p>
<p>By the 1890s Social Democratic parties had been established all over
Europe and the Americas. Though sometimes inspired by Marxism in their
critique of the capitalist system, most of them emphasized reform over
revolution, and campaigned for the extension of democracy, workers'
rights, and social services accessible to all. Quite a few had already
developed into mass parties, linked to the trade union movements in
their countries. In Germany, the Social Democratic Party received one
and a half million votes in the 1890 elections, almost 20 percent of the
total (though it got only a small number of parliamentary seats due to
unfair election laws). In the Nordic countries the figures were similar.
In France the Federation of Socialist Workers had already started
gaining control of municipal governments in the 1880s. In spite of the
critique by Engels and others, most Social Democratic parties were
advancing democracy, while beginning to benefit from its fruits.</p>
<p>The global economic crisis of the 1890s changed all of that. Like the
crisis of 2007--08, it started with the near insolvency in 1890 of a
major bank, in this case the British Baring's, caused by excessive
risk-taking in foreign markets. The City of London had known worse
crises, but the difference this time was that the problem spread rapidly
because of increased economic interdependence and came to infect
economies throughout the world. The early 1890s therefore saw the first
global economic crisis, with high unemployment (nearing 20 percent at
one stage in the United States) and massive labor unrest. Many workers
and even young professionals---who for the first time faced unemployment
in high numbers---asked themselves whether capitalism was finished. Even
many members of the establishment began asking the same question, as
unrest spread. Parts of the extreme Left---anarchists mainly---began
terrorist campaigns against the state. There were eleven large-scale
bombings in France in 1892--94, including one in the National Assembly.
Across Europe and the United States political leaders were assassinated:
the president of France in 1894, the Spanish prime minister in 1897, the
empress of Austria in 1898, and the Italian king in 1900. The following
year US president William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American
Exhibition in Buffalo, New York. Rulers the world over were outraged and
fearful.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-12}The unrest of the 1890s split the Social
Democratic movements, just as they were facing unprecedented attacks
from employers and governments. Strikes were crushed, often violently.
Socialists and trade unionists were imprisoned. The fallout from the
first global economic crisis set back the democratic developments of
previous decades. It also produced a revitalized extreme Left among
socialists, who saw democracy as nothing but window-dressing for the
bourgeoisie. The young Vladimir Illich Ulianov, who came to call himself
Lenin, had this background, as did many of the others who would drive
the socialist and worker's movements in Europe to the Left in the first
part of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Different people within the workers' organizations drew different
lessons from the crisis. Quite a few had expected capitalism itself to
collapse as a result of the chaos created by the financial traumas of
the early 1890s. When this did not happen, and---at least in some
regions---the economy was again on the up in the latter part of the
decade, mainstream Social Democrats were pushed further toward trade
union organizing and processes of collective bargaining. They could draw
on the lessons workers had learned from the crisis: that only an
effective union could resist casual dismissals and worsening working
conditions when an economic downturn struck. Union membership
skyrocketed in Germany, France, Italy, and Britain. In Denmark the
central board of trade unions in 1899 agreed to a system of annual
negotiations over wages and working conditions with the employers'
union. This long-term agreement, the first anywhere in the world, was
the beginning of a model that would gradually spread elsewhere. It made
Denmark one of the least polarized countries in the world during the
Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-13}The radical Left in Europe hated nothing
more than the "class-treason" shown by the Danish Social Democrats in
their September Agreement. Having been given a new lease on life by the
crisis, the radicals were more convinced than ever that capitalism was
coming to an end soon, as Marx had predicted. Some of them believed that
the workers themselves, through their political organizations, could
help nudge history toward its logical destination: Strikes, boycotts,
and other forms of collective protest were not only means for improving
the lot of the working class. They could help overthrow the bourgeois
state. The 1890s therefore saw the final split between mainstream
reformist Social Democrats and revolutionary socialists---soon again to
call themselves Communists---which would last up to the end of the Cold
War. The confrontation between the two would become an important part of
the history of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The emergence of politically organized workers' movements was a real
shock to the established system of states in the late nineteenth
century. There were, however, two other essential mobilizations brewing
at the time that neither the political establishment nor their socialist
opponents at first did much to engage. One was the women's campaigns for
political and social justice, which grew in part as a reaction to early
working class agitation for voting rights. Why, some were asking, should
even educated bourgeois women be denied the right to vote, if illiterate
male workers were enfranchised? Others saw some form of solidarity
between women's demands---including for full economic rights or rights
within the family---and the demands of the working class, but they were
probably in the minority during the first wave of feminist agitation.
The militancy of the movement, however, was striking, especially in
Britain before World War I. Having been repeatedly denied their aim of
full political emancipation, the suffragettes were beaten up by police
and engaged in hunger strikes in prison. In a particularly shocking case
a suffragette was killed by throwing herself under one of the king's
horses at the races. They and their sisters ultimately won victories
everywhere, but not as part of the socialist Left.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-14}Growing at the same time as the women's
movement were the anticolonial campaigns. By the 1890s the first shock
of having been occupied and colonized was wearing off in parts of Africa
and Asia. Armed with ideas and concepts adopted from the imperial
metropole, but finessed for local use, the educated elites veered
between benefitting from the colonial system and opposing it in the name
of self-governance. Peasant movements also joined in opposing Western
influence: the Tonghaks in Korea, the Boxers in China, or the jihadis in
North Africa may have wanted a different world from their educated
compatriots, but they, too, helped sow the seeds of anticolonial
resistance. When the United States entered on its first Asian colonial
adventure---in the Philippines in 1899---the local movement that opposed
it consisted both of patricians and peasants. By the early twentieth
century the first anticolonial organizations had already come into
being: the Indian National Congress, the African National Congress in
South Africa, and the precursors to the Indonesian National Party.</p>
<p>While the opponents of capitalism, colonialism, and patriarchy fought
their battles against the establishment, global change was also taking
place within the international system of states. In Europe and in East
Asia, Germany and Japan strengthened their positions. But the most
remarkable change was taking place around Europe's edges. Europe---or,
more precisely, parts of western Europe---had been militarily
predominant on a world scale since the seventeenth century. Since the
eighteenth century a few western European regions had also been
economically paramount globally in terms of innovation, especially
Britain, France, and the Low Countries. By the late nineteenth century,
however, the huge continental states on the fringes of Europe---empires
of a special kind---were catching up with and in some areas overtaking
the key European countries. Russia and the United States were very
different in terms of politics and economic organization. But both had
expanded over vast distances to conquer enormous amounts of territory
from the peoples on their borders. The United States had grown ten times
from its original size in the 1780s, from 375,000 square miles to 3.8
million. Russia had also grown fast since the beginning of the Romanov
dynasty in 1613, and on an even grander scale: From roughly 2 million
square miles to 8.6 million. Britain and France of course had huge
colonial possessions, too. But these were noncontiguous, and mostly
settled by indigenous people---they were much harder to benefit from
economically and to keep under control in the longer run.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-15}As we shall see later in this book, ideas
and a sense of destiny played essential roles in Russian and American
expansion. Elites in both countries believed that their states were
expanding for a reason, that the qualities they possessed as peoples
earmarked them for predominance within their regions
and---eventually---on a global scale. In reaching for predominance, both
elites felt that they were fulfilling a European mission. Having come
from European ancestry, they were in a sense engaged in projects to
globalize Europe, to bring it all the way to the Pacific. Some of their
intellectual leaders also believed that in the process they were making
their own people more European, more centered on European values and
more willing to bear the burden of empire in an imperial age. But at the
same time there were those, in both countries, who saw their expansion
as fundamentally different from that of the European empires. While the
British and French were searching for resources and commercial
advantage, the Russians and Americans had higher motives for their
expansion: to spread ideas of enterprise and social organization, and to
save souls, in politics as well as in religion.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-16}The role of religion is important both on
the American and Russian
side.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en007en">^7^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en007} While the
position of organized faith was already in decline in Europe (and in
many other places, too) by the end of the nineteenth century, Russians
and Americans still saw religion as has having a central place in their
lives. In a certain sense, there were similarities between American
Evangelical Protestantism and Russian Orthodoxy. Both emphasized
teleology and certainty of faith above what was common in other
Christian groups. Being unconcerned with concepts of original sin, both
believed in the perfectibility of society. Most importantly, both
Evangelicals and Orthodox believed that their religion inspired their
politics in a direct sense. They alone were set to fulfill God's plan
for and with man.</p>
<p>In different ways both the American and the Russian entries into global
affairs were colored by the contest each of them had with the dominant
world power of the late nineteenth century, Great Britain. Americans
resented Britain's trade privileges abroad and found its proclaimed
principles of free trade and freedom of investment to be sanctimonious
and self-serving. In spite of the admiration that many elite Americans
had for British ways, by the 1890s the two countries were increasingly
rivals for influence, not least in South America, the continent that
first witnessed the rise in US global power. In Russia, too, the British
world system was seen as the main obstacle to its rise. Since the
Crimean War of the 1850s, when a British-led coalition checked Russian
control of the Black Sea region, many Russians viewed Britain as an
anti-Russian hegemon, intent on foiling their country's ascendance.
British and Russian interests clashed in Central Asia and in the
Balkans, and in 1905 British support was seen as instrumental in Japan
winning its war against Russia. Unlike the United States, Russia did not
see the economic development that could launch it as a potential
successor state to Britain as a global capitalist hegemon. But in the
combination of territorial expansion and economic backwardness lay the
germs of Russia's rise---in its Soviet Marxist form---as a global
antisystemic power.</p>
<p>[]{#preface001.xhtml#page-17}<strong>E[VEN THOUGH THE]{.small-caps}</strong> Cold War
represented the international emergence of the United States as the
successor to Great Britain, it would be entirely wrong to see this
succession as peaceful or smooth. For most of the twentieth century, the
United States was a revolutionary influence on world politics and on
societies abroad. This is as true for its impact on Europe (including
Britain) as for Latin America, Asia, or Africa. Henry James was not far
off the mark when in the 1870s he saw his American hero as "the great
Western Barbarian, stepping forth in his innocence and might, gazing a
while at this poor effete Old World and then swooping down on
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en008en">^8^</a>{#preface001.xhtml#en008} The United
States was an international troublemaker, who at first refused to play
by the rules British hegemony had established in the nineteenth century.
Its ideas were revolutionary, its mores were upsetting, and its
doctrinarism dangerous. Only as the Cold War was coming to a close did
US hegemony begin to sit comfortably on a global scale.</p>
<p>The Cold War was therefore about the rise and the solidification of US
power. But it was also about more than that. It was about the defeat of
Soviet-style Communism and the victory, in Europe, of a form of
democratic consensus that had become institutionalized through the
European Union. In China it meant a political and social revolution
carried out by the Chinese Communist Party. In Latin America it meant
the increasing polarization of societies along Cold War ideological
lines of division. This book attempts to show the significance of the
Cold War between capitalism and socialism on a world scale, in all its
varieties and its sometimes confusing inconsistencies. As a one-volume
history it can do little but scratch the surface of complicated
developments. But it will have served its purpose if it invites the
reader to explore further the ways in which the Cold War made the world
what it is today.

<p>The Cold War originated in two processes that took place around the turn
of the twentieth century. One was the transformation of the United
States and Russia into two supercharged empires with a growing sense of
international mission. The other was the sharpening of the ideological
divide between capitalism and its critics. These came together with the
American entry into World War I and with the Russian Revolution of 1917,
and the creation of a Soviet state as an alternative vision to
capitalism. As a result of world war and depression, the Soviet
alternative attracted much support around the world, but it also became
a focus point for its enemies and rivals. By 1941, when both the USSR
and the United States entered World War II, the Soviet Union was
internally more powerful than ever, but also more isolated
internationally. The wartime interaction between the Soviets, the United
States, and the greatest of the nineteenth-century powers, Great
Britain, would determine the future framework for international
relations.</p>
<p>While the Soviet Union opposed world capitalism, the United States
became its leader, though under circumstances that no European would
have dreamed about a generation earlier. The history of the world in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is first and foremost a
history of the growth of American power, economically, technologically,
and militarily. In the fifty years between the American Civil War and
World War I, the US gross domestic product (GDP) multiplied more than
seven times. Its steel production, which in 1870 had been at only 5
percent of British levels, by 1913 was four times that of Britain. By
that year, the United States had the most industrial patents of any
country in the world. The combination of technological change and
abundant natural resources created a juggernaut of capitalist
development that, within a generation, would put all competitors to
shame.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-20}Part of the US success was how its massive
economic power intersected with the daily lives of American citizens.
Other rising powers in history had seen their rise mainly benefit their
elites, while ordinary people had to be satisfied with the scraps left
at the table of empire. The United States changed all that. Its economic
rise created a domestic consumer society that everyone could aspire to
take part in, including recent immigrants and African-Americans, who
were otherwise discriminated against and had little political influence.
New products offered status and convenience, and the experience of
modernity through goods produced by new technology defined what it meant
to be American: it was about transformation, a new beginning in a
country where resources and ideas fertilized each other through their
abundance.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, concepts of uniqueness, mission, and
abundance came together to create a US foreign policy ideology of great
force and coherence. In its own mind, the United States was different
from other places: more modern, more developed, and more rational.
Americans also felt an obligation toward the rest of the
European-dominated world to help re-create it in the US image. But while
few Americans doubted that the United States was a more advanced form of
European civilization, they were divided about what kind of power this
advantage entitled them to. Some still believed in the framework
established by the American Revolution: that it was the example set by
US republicanism, thrift, and enterprise that would affect the rest of
the world and make peoples elsewhere want to restart the European
experience, the way Americans themselves had done. Others believed that
in a world of expanding empires the United States had to lead from the
front. Instead of only acting as an example it had to intervene to set
the world right; the world needed not only American ideas but American
power.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-21}Ideas and power came together at the turn
of the century with the US victory in the Spanish-American War. Though
the war lasted less than four months, the United States got a colonial
empire that included the former Spanish possessions of the Philippines,
Guam, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. The first US governor of the Philippines,
William Howard Taft, made the islands an experiment in what he saw as an
American type of development: capitalism, education, modernity, and
orderliness. When elected US president in 1908, Taft stressed the
beneficial role US capital could play abroad, in the Caribbean, Central
America, or Pacific Asia. But he also underlined the plentiful
opportunities for US companies to earn money abroad and the government's
duty to protect them. Taft's "dollar diplomacy" was a sign of his
country's global ascendance.</p>
<p><strong>B[Y 1914 THE]{.small-caps}</strong> United States was a world power. But its
leaders were still uncertain about their country's role on the world
stage. Should the American purpose be effective intervention or
effective insulation? Was the main aim of American power to protect its
own people or save the world? These debates came together in President
Woodrow Wilson's decision to join World War I in 1917. Wilson believed
that part of the US mission was to help set the world right. His policy
toward Mexico, where he intervened twice, was based on the principle
that it was in the interest of the United States to push its southern
neighbor toward constitutionalism and an American form of democracy.
Wilson's sympathies were entirely with the Allied Powers, headed by the
British, French, and Russians, fighting against the Central Powers led
by Germany and Austria-Hungary. What pushed him to intervene was German
submarine warfare against international shipping between the United
States and the Allied countries. In his declaration of war, Wilson
promised to "vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life
of the world as against selfish and autocratic power" and make the world
"safe for
democracy."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en009en">^1^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en009} His
rhetoric during America's short war in Europe focused on the need to
battle against chaos and unrest, and to preserve freedom, for men, for
commerce, and for trade.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-22}Wilson was the first southerner elected
president since before the Civil War, and his views on race and the US
mission reflected those held by white men of his time. To the president,
part of America's global task was to gradually improve the ability of
others to practice democracy and capitalism. For this mission, Wilson
thought in terms of a clear racial hierarchy. White Americans and
western Europeans were already well suited for the task. Central,
eastern, and southern Europeans had to be prepared for it. Latin
Americans, Asians, and Africans had to be enlightened and educated
through guidance or trusteeships until they could really start to take
responsibility for their own affairs. To Wilson, who was essentially a
liberal internationalist, the capacities to make rational political
decisions and to make economic decisions went together. Only those who
had mastered the latter would master the former. The American role was
to prepare the world for a time when such decisions would universally be
made, and when a peaceful equilibrium would be promoted through trade
and free economic interaction.</p>
<p>While the United States, at least in the eyes of most of its citizens,
came to fulfill the promise of capitalism and the market, Russia in the
late nineteenth century was for many about the negation of these values.
Though business and industrial production expanded under Tsar Nicholas
II's reign (1894--1917), both the government and much of the opposition
attempted to find alternatives that would not take Russia through the
furnace of a market transformation. Throughout the nineteenth century,
the Russian Empire relentlessly expanded from eastern Europe to central
Asia to Manchuria and Korea. Just as many Americans believed in a
continental definition of their country, well before any such
possibility existed, many Russians felt their destiny was to forge a
dominion from sea to sea, from the Baltic and the Black Sea to the
Caspian and the Pacific. Empires such as Britain and France might have
expanded through sea power, but Russia aimed at creating a contiguous
land empire, settled by its own people, in a territory almost twice the
size of the continental United States.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-23}Inside this new Russia, old and new ideas
wrestled for primacy. Sometimes they came together in surprising
combinations. The tsar's advisers often denigrated the market as a
pollution of the values that upheld Russian-ness and empire: hierarchy,
authenticity, empathy, and religion, as well as learning and culture,
were being lost in a frenzied search for material advantage. Even those
who did not support the tsar felt that natural, direct, genuine forms of
personal interaction were being lost, and might be replaced by
inauthentic and foreign ways of living. All of this fueled
anticapitalist resistance in Russia both on the Right and the Left in
the years before World War I. The few who believed in the ideas of
liberal capitalism were often lost in the melee.</p>
<p>In this anticapitalist chorus in Russia, the Social Democratic Party
stood out as one of the movements that linked the empire to broader
trends in Europe. Founded in 1898, the party's background was in Marxist
thinking, which of course connected it to significant parts of the labor
movement in Germany, France, and Italy. Already before its Second
Congress, in 1903, the tsar's police had driven most of the Social
Democratic leaders into exile abroad. And so the Second Congress
convened in London, where the party split into two factions, the
"majority" (Bolsheviks in Russian) and "minority" (Mensheviks). The
split was as much personal as political. Many party members resented the
personal control that Lenin, now the head of the Bolsheviks, was trying
to install over the party organization. The split contributed to chaos
among the tsar's opponents. Lenin was not a man of easy compromise.</p>
<p>Since well before the London Congress, Lenin had sustained his followers
on dreams of a Russian revolution and the conquest of state power. He
was born Vladimir Illich Ulianov in 1870, into a liberal bourgeois
family in a town five hundred miles east of Moscow. The key moment in
his young life came in 1887. His older brother, Aleksandr, a member of a
Left-wing terrorist group that planned to assassinate the tsar, was
arrested and executed. Vladimir soon joined a radical student
association and read voraciously not just in Russian but in German,
French, and English. In 1897 he was arrested and banished to Siberia,
where he took his nom de guerre, Lenin, from the river Lena. Living in a
peasant's hut under police surveillance for three years, he read, wrote,
and organized. In his first major published work, <em>What Is to Be Done?</em>,
from 1902, he quotes an 1852 letter from the German socialist Ferdinand
Lassalle to Marx: "Party struggles lend a party strength and vitality;
the greatest proof of a party's weakness is its diffuseness and the
blurring of clear demarcations; a party becomes stronger by purging
itself."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en010en">^2^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en010} Released
from exile, Lenin was ready for battle.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-24}<strong>T[HE FIRST OPENING]{.small-caps}</strong> for
the Russian revolutionaries came very unexpectedly. In 1905, the Russian
empire lost its war against Japan, and the shock of defeat set off
massive antigovernment demonstrations in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In
the capital the socialist Lev Bronshtein, who called himself Trotsky,
led an autonomous workers' council (a soviet), which opposed the
authorities. All the Russian opposition demanded free elections and the
introduction of some form of parliamentary democracy. The tsar gave in
to a few of the demands, but he and his advisers tried to control the
government and steer it away from a dependence on the new elected
parliament, the Duma. The Bolsheviks participated in the 1905 events,
but Lenin did not believe in elections as the road to socialism.
Combined, the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks never gained more than 5 percent
of elected representatives.</p>
<p>The wider world around the turn of the century was in a state of
increasing social and political tension. New conflicts were gradually
gnawing away at the optimistic European vision of a future imbued by
scientific rationalism, gradual progress, and new opportunities. The
economic crisis of 1893 had hit particularly hard in the United States,
with increases in unemployment and decreases in working-class income
that were to last for several years. While more territory in Africa and
Asia was being colonized in a relentless hunt for resources, markets,
and prestige, the first organized anticolonial movements appeared in
India, South Africa, southeast Asia, and the Middle East. But in spite
of this dissonance, which led to increased class conflict and armed
resistance, the concept of a better tomorrow held fast in Europe and in
the European offshoots elsewhere. There had been no all-European war for
close to a hundred years, and most people assumed that rational
thinking, commitment to people's welfare, and economic interdependence
would prevent one in the future. The new century would surely get a few
hiccups, but the overall path to progress was linear and permanent.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-25}1914 changed all of that. As they marched
their young men off to war, European elites began a form of collective
suicide that would kill off many of them and deprive those still left of
much of their wealth and their position in the world. World War I was
the beginning of a thirty-year European civil war that would give rise
to revolutions, new states, economic dislocation, and destruction on a
scale that nobody at the start of 1914 would have thought possible. More
than fifteen million died in World War I, most of them European men in
their prime. More than twenty-one million were wounded. In France, GDP
declined by 40 percent, in Germany by more than twice that. The
Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires vanished. Britain introduced the
rationing of food for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>But worse than the physical effects of total war were its psychological
consequences. A whole generation of Europeans learned that killing,
destroying, and hating your neighbors were regular, normal aspects of
life, and that the moral certainties of the nineteenth century were
mainly empty phrases. They learned to distrust the existing order, which
had led them into a war that had no victors and no noble purpose. After
the battle of the Somme in 1916, one young Welshman wrote in his diary:
"It was life rather than death that faded into the distance, as I grew
into a state of not-thinking, not-feeling, not-seeing.... Men passed me
by, carrying other men, some crying, some cursing, some silent. They
were all shadows, and I was no greater than they. Living or dead, all
were unreal.... Past and future were equidistant and unattainable,
throwing no bridge of desire across the gap that separated me from my
remembered self and from all that I hoped to
grasp."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en011en">^3^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en011}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-26}It was the World War I generation who went
on to shape the Cold War. All the elements of the Great War were in it:
fear, uncertainty, the need for something to believe in, and the demand
to create a better world. The desperation created by total war in Europe
and the fear that it would spread to much of the rest of the globe was
in the minds of all those who experienced it, regardless of where they
experienced it. Major Clement Attlee, later British prime minister,
fought in Turkey and Iraq. Captain Harry Truman fought in the important
Meuse-Argonne offensive. Second Lieutenant Dwight D. Eisenhower trained
soldiers for the front. Konrad Adenauer, later West German chancellor,
was mayor of war-stricken Cologne, Germany's fourth-largest city. Joseph
Stalin, who created the Soviet Union, castigated the war from his
revolutionary exile in Siberia. Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Cold War
revolutionary, saw France reduced and formed his country's first
independence movement. They all grew out of the disasters of World War
I.</p>
<p>The Communist challenge to the capitalist world system also started with
the Great War. The war split Social Democratic parties everywhere into
prowar and antiwar camps. Some Social Democrats supported the war
efforts out of a sense of obligation to the nation. But in Germany,
France, Italy, and Russia, minority socialists, including the Russian
Bolsheviks, condemned the fighting as a conflict between different
groups of capitalists. Karl Liebknecht, the only socialist who voted
against the war in the German parliament, bravely argued that "this war,
which none of the peoples involved desired, was not started for the
benefit of the German or of any other people. It is an imperialist war,
a war for capitalist domination of world markets and for the political
domination of important colonies in the interest of industrial and
financial
capital."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en012en">^4^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en012}</p>
<p>Revolutionaries such as Liebknecht and Lenin contended that soldiers,
workers, and peasants had more in common with their brothers on the
other side than with their superior officers and the capitalists behind
the lines. The war was between robbers and thieves, for which ordinary
people had to suffer. Capitalism itself produced war and would produce
more wars if it was not abolished. The answer, the ultra-Left
proclaimed, was a transnational form of revolution, in which soldiers
turned their weapons on their own officers and embraced their comrades
across the trenches.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-27}The Great War jump-started the destinies of
the two future Cold War Superpowers. It made the United States the
global embodiment of capitalism and it made Russia a Soviet Union, a
permanent challenge to the capitalist world. The outcome of the conflict
therefore prefigured the Cold War as an international system, even
though much was to happen before the full bipolarity of the late
twentieth century came into being. The radical Communists emerging from
World War I were not the only challengers to capitalism, however. The
Italian Fascists (Partito Nazionale Fascista) and the German Nazis
(Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) came out of the same
Great War cauldron. But it was the birth of Communist power in the
world's biggest empire that set the course for the longest conflict of
the twentieth century, through the state it created and through the
impact it had elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik takeover in Russia came because the empire, a wartime ally
of France and Britain, was weakened by the war. As 1917 began, the
situation at the front was dismal, with no victory in sight. The liberal
opposition was tarnished among the population because of its support of
the war. When the Russian monarchy was overthrown in a revolution in
March 1917, the influence of the Bolsheviks was limited. But the
liberal-socialist coalition that came to power after the revolution
could not end the war or deal with its catastrophic economic effects.
Lenin's slogan "Land, Bread, Peace," as well as his popularity among
other socialists because of his opposition to the war, increased his
political sway. In November 1917, with the provisional government
further weakened through infighting, the Bolsheviks pulled off a coup
d'état and took power in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) and Moscow.</p>
<p>The October Revolution, which, following the old Russian calendar, was
the Bolshevik term for their November coup, began a profound
transformation of Russia. In 1918 the Bolsheviks chased out the elected
constitutional assembly and established the Russian Socialist Federative
Soviet Republic. The civil war that followed, between the Bolsheviks'
Red Army and a multifaceted anti-Bolshevik White Army, killed two
million people. The Bolsheviks gradually, and very surprisingly, even to
themselves, were able to turn the military tide to their advantage. In
1922 the Russian Soviet republic became the centerpiece of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), a federation of sixteen republics
carved out from the former empire, all ruled by the Bolsheviks. Lenin's
followers, who now called themselves Communists, won the war because
they had genuine support in the population, most of whom did not want to
go back to the discredited old imperial state. Liberals and socialists,
who had provided many of the leaders in the struggle against Lenin's
coup, had to depend on tsarist officers for military support, and that
cost them much esteem in the eyes of the population.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-28}The Bolsheviks' coming to power horrified
elites in the countries that had been Russia's allies in World War I. To
them, the Bolsheviks were a nightmare within a bad dream: not only did
Lenin end Russia's war against Germany, he proclaimed that the supreme
aim of his state was revolution in <em>all</em> European countries, preferably
by violence, as had happened in Petrograd. The allies intervened in the
Russian civil war at first to help those non-Bolsheviks who wanted to
continue to fight against Germany and Austria-Hungary. But the
intervention soon became directed against the Bolshevik regime itself.
The foreign forces remained in place after the European war ended in
1918. Their Russian protégés were militarily unreliable and politically
weak, and the interventions ultimately had little effect. But they did
convince new recruits to the Bolshevik cause that the capitalist world
would not hesitate to use arms against them if given a chance. Lenin's
regime could now rightly call itself the defender of Russia against
foreigners.</p>
<p><strong>T[HE END OF]{.small-caps}</strong> the war saw the United States as the main
economic and political power in the world. It alone held a surplus of
credit and industrial supplies. The war also ended with the United
States as the world's foremost moral authority in politics. In his
Fourteen Points, describing American war aims and peace terms, President
Wilson had proclaimed that the United States fought for a just world,
not simply for national advantage. As a state built on ideas and
principles, it stood above mere nation-states. It believed that all
competent nations had the right to self-government and to participation
in a new world organization, the League of Nations. When the United
States intervened against the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1918, it claimed
to do so because it would "render such aid as may be acceptable to the
Russians in the organization of their own
self-defense."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en013en">^5^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en013} In
reality, US elites were as horror-struck by Lenin's rule as were the
Europeans. It was rare to see, either in the press or in Congress, a
reference to the Communists that did not include terms such as
"murderers" or "savages." Wilson, himself more cool-headed, saw the
Soviet project as a competing form of internationalism to his own
variant.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-29}Just as the USSR in the 1920s would give up
on immediate revolution in Europe, the United States soon gave up on
Wilson's dream of rearranging Europe through the League of Nations. But
the isolationism that America is often blamed for in the 1920s and '30s
was never a reality. More Americans than ever before went abroad to
Europe and elsewhere. The cultural exchange, and the exchange in goods
and services, between America and the rest of the world increased
sharply. In Europe, Asia, and Latin America, US consumer products were
all the rage: cars, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, radios, and films
did more to transform families and societies than did most political
projects. Even in an era dominated by high tariffs and import
restrictions, US foreign trade and investment increased sharply. From
the 1920s on, the financial center of the world moved from Great Britain
to the United States, from London to Wall Street.</p>
<p>Nowhere was this increased US influence more striking than in Europe.
For centuries European elites had been the arbiters of global taste and
purpose. In Russia, in America, and in the colonized world, the ideal of
the English gentleman or the learned French <em>philosophe</em> ruled. But in
the interwar years, America brought change to Europe in ways nobody
could have foreseen before World War I. US ways of conducting business
replaced old European traditions: on crucial matters such as management
styles and accounting methods, and also---though more
gradually---principles of investment. In factories the assembly line,
pioneered by Henry Ford in Detroit, objectified output and linked man
and machine. Fordism, meaning synchronization, precision, and
specialization in production, also spread to other spheres of life, and
the technological approach to organization was taken up not just by
western European liberals, but by Fascists, Nazis, and Soviet
Communists.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en014en">^6^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en014} But
the Americanization of Europe went further than the assembly line in
advanced production. Attitudes and ideals were also gradually changing.
The concept of holding a job with regular hours and regular pay was
foreign to most Europeans at the turn of the century. Even for those who
worked in industry, older, more paternalistic mores applied, as did
rules set by guilds or hometown associations. Aristocrats never held a
job, of course, but neither did the peasants and laborers over whom they
lorded. Europe had been changing in this sense for a very long time. But
the Americanization of the post-1918 era capped the turn toward a market
economy with distinctive US characteristics.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-30}The rapid change created by war and its
effects gave rise to an extraordinary climate of fear among many people
in Europe and elsewhere. The most destructive of these fears centered on
individual or national humiliation and destitution. It was claimed that
radicals, Jews, capitalists, Communists, or neighboring states were out
to exploit those who had already suffered and sacrificed in the Great
War and its aftermath. In Europe the fear gave rise to nationalist
authoritarian movements such as Fascism and Nazism. But it also created
new forms of antirevolutionary thinking that focused on the threat that
Communism and the Russian revolution posed to religion, individual
liberty, and social advancement through self-improvement. In the United
States, the Red Scare of 1919--20 led to arrests and deportations of
suspected radicals, restrictions on the freedom of speech, and federal
assistance for employers to break strikes and workers' protests. In
1920, Seattle's mayor, Ole Hanson, embodied the Scare:</p>

<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-31}In the United States and Britain,
liberalism split under the pressure of war and radical challenges. In
ways similar to what would happen after World War II, many liberals
joined with conservatives in a wave of antirevolutionary activism.
Winston Churchill, in 1920 still a Liberal member of Parliament, said,
"In every city there are small bands of eager men and women, watching
with hungry eyes any chance to make a general overturn in the hopes of
profiting themselves in the confusion, and these miscreants are fed by
Bolshevist money.... They are ceaselessly endeavoring by propagating the
doctrines of communism, by preaching violent revolution, by inflaming
discontent, to infect us with their
disease."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en016en">^8^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en016} Only a
few liberal skeptics remained. While criticizing the methods the
Bolsheviks used, the philosopher Bertrand Russell believed that "the
heroism of Russia has fired men's
hopes."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en017en">^9^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en017} For
Russell, in the early years of the Russian Revolution, the possibility
for a better world explained its attractiveness.</p>
<p>In the interwar years, many people felt a great betrayal. Instead of the
good life, their countries' elites had given them war. Instead of
increased opportunity, they got unemployment and more exploitation. In
the colonies, many local leaders concluded that the war and the
subsequent economic crises proved that the Europeans only cared about
themselves, not about progress for those they ruled overseas. Soviet
Communism seemed a viable alternative to war, destitution, and
oppression. The new Communist International organization (the Third
International, or the Comintern), set up by Lenin in 1919, included
brand-new Communist parties in many countries, constructed after the
Bolshevik model. It defined national Communist parties simply as
branches of the Comintern, under a strong, centralized, Soviet
leadership. Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese anticolonial activist who would
eventually lead North Vietnam, wrote, "At first, patriotism, not yet
Communism, led me to have confidence in Lenin, in the Third
International. Step by step, along the struggle, by studying
Marxism-Leninism parallel with participation in practical activities, I
gradually came upon the fact that only Socialism and Communism can
liberate the oppressed nations and the working people throughout the
world from
slavery."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en018en">^10^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en018} The
voice of Communist revolution, wrote the Norwegian poet Rudolf Nilsen,
called out to "burning hearts" everywhere:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-32}<em>Yes, give me the best from amongst you,
and I shall give you all.</em></p>
<p><em>No one can know till victory is mine how much to us shall fall.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe it means we shall save our earth.</em></p>
<p><em>To the best goes out my
call.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en019en">^11^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en019}</em>
:::</p>
<p>The call of the Comintern was heard throughout a world that was tired of
war and colonial oppression. Most Communist parties began small and
formed alliances with other, larger movements. For example, the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921, worked with the Guomindang, the
National People's Party, a much bigger nationalist group founded in 1919
by the physician and revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. In Iran, where an
ill-fated Soviet republic had been set up in the north in 1920, the
Communist Party was forced underground, where its members concentrated
on setting up trade unions and urban organizations. In South Africa, its
Communist Party, also founded in 1921, appealed "to all South African
workers, organized and unorganized, white and black, to join in
promoting the overthrow of the capitalist system and outlawry of the
capitalist class, and the establishment of a Commonwealth of Workers
throughout the
World."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en020en">^12^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en020} It later
worked within the African National Congress (ANC) and provided many of
the leaders in the struggle against apartheid. The Comintern linked all
of these parties together and, gradually, helped turn them into
instruments of Soviet foreign policy. But the Communist International
had an influence that went beyond just the Communist parties themselves.
The first global anti-imperial movement, the League Against Imperialism,
set up in Brussels in 1927, was, for instance, funded and mostly
organized by the Comintern.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-33}While dreamers dreamed of a Communist
revolution that would save the world, Lenin and his successors began
constructing socialism in their new state. But the plans went awry
almost immediately. Not only did the economy collapse, as wealthy and
educated people fled the Communist regime and untrained political
devotees replaced them; but the civil war, the war against foreign
intervention, and the bloody invasions of Soviet power into former parts
of the Russian Empire that had declared themselves independent all cost
the regime dearly. By 1920 it was reduced to confiscating food from
peasants to transport to workers in the cities. Lenin's decision the
following year to test out market incentives in order to get the economy
going again, the so-called New Economic Policy (NEP), was never more
than a tactical ploy and was abolished as soon as it had brought
immediate results. The low point for the Communists was a costly and
badly fought war against Poland, in which the USSR lost much territory
that used to be part of the Russian Empire to the new Polish state. The
Polish victory forestalled Soviet attacks on the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which now solidified their independence.</p>
<p>But for the Soviet leaders the failure of revolution elsewhere in Europe
was even worse than the loss of territory for the Soviet state. A core
idea behind Lenin's seizure of power in 1917 had been that his
revolution would soon be followed by others in more socially and
technologically advanced parts of Europe. Together they would form a
continent-wide Soviet Union fueled toward a higher stage of modernity by
European know-how and Russian resources, including its revolutionary
discipline. But there were to be no successful revolutions elsewhere. In
Berlin, an uprising of Left-wing socialists was crushed in January 1919,
and its leaders---Karl Liebknecht among them---were murdered. The
Bavarian Soviet Republic lasted a mere twenty-seven days before it was
defeated in May 1919 by remnants from the German Army in the streets of
Munich. In Hungary, the center of the eastern part of the former
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Communists held out the longest. But in
August 1919 the Hungarian Soviet Republic went down in flames in the
face of invading Romanian troops supported by France and Britain.
Preoccupied with its own civil war, the USSR could do nothing to help.
By the early 1920s it was clear that no other Communist revolutions
would follow that in Russia, at least not anytime soon. But the deep
enmity of the victorious powers against the Soviet Union would remain.
The outlook seemed bleak for Moscow's new rulers.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-34}Even so, the Communists gradually managed
to stabilize the Soviet government, albeit in a different form from what
they had first thought. After Lenin's death in 1924, the party
organization was led by Iosif Dzhugashvili, a Georgian Communist who
called himself Stalin, the "man of steel." Born in 1878 in a small town
in rural Georgia, Stalin had very little formal education. From the age
of twenty-one, he worked for Lenin and his party, specializing in the
most dangerous jobs such as bank robberies and occasional
assassinations. By 1922, Stalin had become general secretary of the
Communist Party, meaning head of the central party administration. Six
years later he had defeated all his political rivals to become
uncontested master of the party and the Soviet state. While doing so,
Stalin and his followers had probably saved the government they
represented. How did they do this? They could rely on the abundant
natural and human resources of the former empire. They had the
organizational ability of the Communist Party to use those resources.
They employed centralized power and economic and social planning for
greater efficiency. Finally, they used terror against enemies, real and
imagined. Stalin's aim was a totalitarian society, in which everyone
followed one will and one set of aims in pursuit of socialist
construction. And although he never entirely managed to build such a
society, the state that had Stalin as its leader seemed an impressive
machine to friends and foes alike.</p>
<p>The human cost of Stalin's state-building was immense. Lenin had set a
bloody pattern by executing at least one hundred thousand people without
any form of judicial
process.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en021en">^13^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en021} Most
were killed simply because they were "class enemies" or had worked for
the old regime. Lenin had also instituted the one-party dictatorship and
intolerance toward any opposition. But Stalin, the man his closest
associates called <em>vozhd</em>, the Boss, took these murderous and
antidemocratic principles to genocidal lengths. The campaigns against
Trotsky and those who had supported him in the inner-party struggle
after Lenin's death set the pattern in the late 1920s. Then came the
terrible campaign against kulaks, rich peasants, to "exterminate them as
a class" and thereby ease the transfer of all land into public hands. In
the 1930s millions of innocent Soviet citizens were arrested,
imprisoned, deported, or shot. The total figures are hard to estimate.
At least ten million Soviet people were killed by Stalin's regime from
the late 1920s up to his death in 1953. Twenty-three million were
imprisoned or deported. In addition, at least three million died in the
Ukrainian famine, which the regime did much to provoke and nothing to
prevent. Massacres and executions of Poles, Karelians, Baltic peoples,
or peoples of the Caucasus are impossible to estimate in numbers, but
are rightly characterized as genocide. The Soviet regime under Stalin
was savage to its own people and to other peoples alike, in ways that
did nothing to contribute to the economic growth it recorded.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-35}How could the Soviet system, based on
terror and subjugation, appeal to so many people around the world? The
Great Depression provided the opportunity. If it had not been for
capitalism doing so very badly, Communism would not have won the
affection of large numbers of dedicated and intelligent people
everywhere. In the eyes of many, capitalism had already produced war and
colonial enslavement. After the stock market crash in 1929, it produced
poverty, too, even in the most advanced industrial economies. The
Soviets did not do so well, at least not after the mid-1920s, although
the regime managed to survive. But world capitalism was seemingly intent
on self-destruction in the 1930s. In the first three years after the
crash, world GDP fell by about 15 percent, and it stagnated after that.
Overall capitalism had a very bad run in the first half of the twentieth
century. It was easy to inflame world opinion against it and in favor of
ideals of social justice and defense of local communities, even when
such values were presented by thugs and murderers.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-36}The Soviet Union was not the only
collectivist challenger to liberal capitalism in the interwar years. In
Italy, the Fascists, headed by Benito Mussolini, claimed that their
combination of nationalism and socialism was the way forward. In Munich
in 1923, just four years after the defeat of the Bavarian Soviet
Republic, a young German extremist, Adolf Hitler, tried to grab power on
behalf of his Nazi Party. Hitler failed at first, but his party built on
its extreme nationalism, anticapitalism, and anti-Semitism to present an
alternative both to the liberal Weimar Republic and its Communist
challengers. In the 1928 elections the Nazis still got less than 3
percent of the vote. After the worldwide economic crisis hit Germany,
with 40 percent unemployment and inflation spiraling out of control, in
1930 the Nazis got 18 percent and two years later 37 percent, making
them by far the biggest party in the country. Hitler took over the
German government in 1933 and made the country a one-party state, like
the Soviet Union and Italy. A number of eastern European, Asian, and
Latin American countries also moved toward one-party dictatorships. By
the mid-1930s, it seemed that not only capitalism but also political
pluralism were dead or dying everywhere except in Britain and its
dominions, and in the United States.</p>
<p>The new one-party states formed a collectivist challenge to capitalist
ideals. Though they shared a disdain for individual freedom and
democratic practices, for the bourgeoisie, and for Social Democratic
mass parties, they saw each other as worst enemies because each aspired
to exterminate any rival ideology on its territory and because, for most
of them, their nationalisms were constructed in opposition to the
nationalisms of their neighbors. The exception to the latter was the
Soviet Union, which under Stalin constructed a very peculiar form of
national identity, idealizing the Soviet state as the natural "homeland"
of workers everywhere while also drawing on symbols of the Russian past
to gain support at home. Communism was fundamentally different from
Fascist and Nazi ideologies in this sense: in spite of Stalin's visibly
prioritizing the Soviet state, Communist ideology was internationalist,
not nationalist. It was authoritarian and ruthless, while at the same
time appealing to global solidarity and social justice. Communists in
Europe and elsewhere were often among the bravest and most unselfish
opponents of Fascist dictatorships in their own countries, while
refusing to speak out against oppression in Stalin's USSR.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-37}As Nazism and Fascism grew stronger,
Stalin's Communists prevented working-class organizations from joining
together to resist them. Between 1928 and 1935, the Comintern defined
Socialists and Social Democrats as "Social Fascists," telling workers
everywhere that there was really no difference between Adolf Hitler and
German democrats such as the liberal Gustav Stresemann or the Social
Democrat Hermann Müller. However unreasonable this view was, most
Communists were willing to follow it. Young German Social Democrats,
such as Herbert Frahm (who during the Cold War became chancellor of West
Germany under the name Willy Brandt), condemned Communist attacks on the
other parties of the Left and blamed them for indirectly assisting
Hitler's rise. The German Communist Party, which by 1932 had three
hundred thousand members and one hundred representatives in the
Reichstag, stuck with Stalin's views, summarized by the Comintern:
"Fascism is a militant organization of the bourgeoisie resting on the
active support of Social Democracy. Social Democracy is objectively the
moderate wing of
Fascism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en022en">^14^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en022}</p>
<p>As international tensions rose in the mid-1930s, Stalin consolidated his
hold on the Communist Party and the Soviet state. He was already firmly
in charge, but in his suspicious mind he convinced himself and others
that there were large-scale plots afoot to undermine Communist power
from within the USSR. Stalin turned on all who could seem a threat to
him. Arresting, deporting, or executing perceived class enemies was of
course nothing new in the Soviet Union. But the late 1930s Great Purge,
as it became known, was also directed against Communist Party members.
By 1937 nobody was safe. Close to a million people were executed for
crimes that were largely invented by the regime. Many times that number
died during the decade from deliberate starvation, overwork in labor
camps, or from neglect and ill-treatment during large-scale
deportations. Among those arrested were almost all of the original
leaders of the Bolshevik party. It was as if Stalin's rule could not be
safe unless all those who had been witness to his rise were eliminated.
Nikolai Bukharin, who had been Lenin's favorite colleague, was arrested
and executed in 1938. After having been tortured and, presumably, out of
a perverted loyalty to the party he had helped found, Bukharin agreed to
sign a confession written in part by Stalin himself: "I am guilty of
treason to the socialist fatherland, the most heinous of possible
crimes, of the organization of kulak uprisings, of preparations for
terrorist acts and of belonging to an underground, anti-Soviet
organization.... The extreme gravity of the crime is obvious, the
political responsibility immense, the legal responsibility such that it
will justify the severest sentence. The severest sentence would be
justified, because a man deserves to be shot ten times over for such
crimes."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en023en">^15^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en023}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-38}The Moscow trials did little to dampen the
faith of Communists elsewhere. Most of them believed in Stalin's claims:
that he had saved the USSR from attacks by its enemies. In the Spanish
Civil War, Communists from all over the world met up to help fight the
forces of General Francisco Franco. With the help of Hitler and
Mussolini, Franco was trying to unseat the constitutional government in
Spain and set up a Fascist dictatorship. It was not only Communists who
offered their help to the Spanish government; anarchists, trade
unionists, and Social Democrats joined, too. But the democratic powers
refused to get involved, and soon Franco's forces were on the march
toward Madrid. In the spring of 1939, the final resistance was crushed.
But before that happened the Communists had had a complete falling-out
with the other internationalists in Spain. Following Stalin's
instructions, the Soviet advisers spent as much time organizing
Communists to fight against Social Democrats, anarchists, and
(suspected) Trotskyists in Spain as they spent on fighting Franco. The
experience of the lost war against Franco taught Communists and Social
Democrats much about what divided them. But it also taught both that
Britain, France, and the United States were unlikely to stand up to
Hitler except in the most extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>The latter half of the 1930s is rightly called the age of appeasement.
Britain had lost its leading role, and its elite was not inclined to
confront the buildup of Hitler's power. France was militarily weak and
politically divided. The United States had no appetite for getting
involved in another war in Europe. Hitler swallowed first Austria (in
1938) and then the western part of Czechoslovakia (in early 1939). The
British, French, and Americans did nothing to stop him. Leaders in those
countries hoped that Hitler's territorial demands were satisfied, and
some of them expected a German-Soviet war to follow. Many British
Conservatives were not unhappy with the prospect of the two
dictatorships tearing each other to pieces. Very few listened to the
likes of Winston Churchill, who, in spite of his visceral
anti-Communism, had realized that only cooperation between France,
Britain, and the Soviet Union could stop Hitler's expansion. Stalin's
desperate attempts at negotiating a collective security arrangement with
the western powers came to nothing.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-39}In Britain, France, and the United States,
more attention was paid to welfare than warfare in the 1930s. Leaders in
all three countries realized that if the disastrous social effects of
the Great Depression were not ameliorated, their political systems would
be threatened from within, from the same kind of forces that had taken
power in Russia, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In Britain the government
introduced unemployment benefits, commenced a program of public works,
and doubled overall welfare spending. France went even further, with
obligatory insurance arrangements and regulated working hours set by the
state. The new administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the United
States broke with the policies of its predecessors and launched what it
called a New Deal. The president termed it "a tremendous adjustment of
our national life." It meant using unprecedented methods of planning and
government regulation to provide relief and stabilize the economy. In
his methods, FDR drew on great American campaigns from the past: the
progressive welfare movement at the turn of the century and the
mobilization of all of US society to fight World War I. The New Deal was
a campaign of great political intensity, intended to jump-start the
economy by getting people back to work. Roosevelt's intention was not to
abolish capitalism, but to use the state to strengthen it so that its
critics both on the Right and the Left could be outplayed and
outnumbered.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-40}Roosevelt's policies divided America. Most
supported him, and he won four presidential elections in a row. But a
vocal minority detested his policies and saw them as socialist and
authoritarian. His foreign policy was equally contentious. Right after
becoming president in 1933, FDR had established diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union. Much was made of this at the time (and later) by
both the president's enemies and friends, but in fact Roosevelt did
little beyond what Britain, France, and even Germany and Italy had done
a long time before: recognize the Soviet regime as a reality that would
not soon go away. By the late 1930s, FDR understood that Nazi Germany
was the greatest threat to international peace, but he had to work hard
to get US public opinion to accept that German aggression might also be
a threat to the United States. A massive majority of Americans, 95
percent in 1936, thought that the United States should stay out of any
war in Europe.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en024en">^16^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en024}
The memory of US intervention in World War I, which most people regarded
as a failed crusade, hung heavy over FDR's foreign policy.</p>
<p>Knowing that at least some western leaders would gladly sacrifice the
USSR to German aggression, Stalin made the move that would unleash World
War II. In August 1939 he signed a treaty of nonaggression with the
enemy he feared most, Adolf Hitler. The pact was not just about not
attacking each other. It was also about dividing parts of eastern Europe
between the two dictators: western Poland went to Hitler, while the pact
allowed Stalin to invade eastern Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, and
Romania. Even if the details of the unlikely compact were not fully
known at the time, the deal between the two archenemies led to
incredulous and furious reactions all over the world. "Whatever the
agreement means," editorialized the <em>New York Times</em>, "it is not peace;
it serves only to aggravate the
crisis."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en025en">^17^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en025} Hitler
attacked Poland on 1 September. Two days later, because of their defense
agreement with the Poles, Britain and France declared war on Germany. On
17 September, the Soviets moved into Poland from the east.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-41}At first, the new European war seemed so
slow-moving that it got called the Phony War. Both sides were wary of
the enormous sacrifices the World War I offensives had demanded. Stalin
stubbornly planned to cash in on his pact with Hitler, even though there
were plenty of warnings that the Nazis were preparing an attack on the
Soviet Union. The new war, the vozhd told his followers, was "between
two groups of capitalist countries---(poor and rich as regards colonies,
raw materials, and so forth)---for the re-division of the world.... We
see nothing wrong in their having a good, hard fight and weakening each
other.... Next time, we'll urge on the other
side."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en026en">^18^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en026} In the
spring of 1940, eight months after it broke out, the Phony War ended and
the real one began as German forces occupied the Netherlands and
Belgium, broke through the French lines, and attacked Denmark and
Norway. France capitulated on 18 June. For an agonizing year, Britain
would be left alone to face a Nazi Germany that dominated the continent.
For the British, as for most people in German-occupied Europe, the
Soviets seemed to be on the German side.</p>
<p>For Communists everywhere the pact between Moscow and Berlin was the
first serious test of their faith. Most stuck with the Soviet version:
that World War II, like World War I, was a war between capitalist
robbers and thieves, in which Communists had no part. The pioneering
folk singer Woody Guthrie, then a Communist sympathizer working in
California, was fired from his first radio job for refusing to condemn
Stalin.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en027en">^19^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en027} But for
French, Dutch, Czech, or Norwegian Communists, who saw their societies
take the full brunt of the Nazi occupation, the fiction was hard to keep
up. On the coast of Norway, some Communists joined with other Leftists
to fight the German presence. "Our country must again become free," they
declared in July 1940. "Fight against the forces of darkness, which want
to destroy our national independence, to tie our people down as slaves,
and to abolish the rights we have gained through hard
struggle."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en028en">^20^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en028} But
the Communist Party leaderships did not accept such behavior. The
Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov, the head of the Comintern,
instructed the French Communist Party that "this is not a war of
democracy against fascism; this is an imperialist, reactionary war on
the part of both France and Germany. In this war a position of national
defense is not a correct one for the French
Communists."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en029en">^21^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en029}
Stalin even sent German Communists, who had fled Hitler's oppression,
back to prison in Germany, because he wanted to show his good faith to
Hitler.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en030en">^22^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en030}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter001.xhtml#page-42}Hitler, however, had never wavered in his
long-term plan to attack and destroy the Soviet Union. But he needed to
find the right time for violating his treaty with Moscow. In the summer
of 1941, with most of Europe occupied, Britain isolated, and no signs of
a direct American involvement in the war, Hitler deemed that the moment
had come. On 22 June 1941, 117 German divisions crossed into Soviet
territory, and the Nazi air force devastated Soviet airfields. Stalin
was so shocked that for hours he refused to believe he was facing an
all-out German
offensive.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en031en">^23^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en031} On 29
June, he growled to his closest comrades, "Lenin founded a great state,
and we fucked it
up."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en032en">^24^</a>{#chapter001.xhtml#en032} The German
attack continued. By November 1941 Hitler's troops conquered Belorussia,
the Baltic states, and western Ukraine. They laid siege to Leningrad
(formerly St. Petersburg, or Petrograd) and stood less than six miles
from Moscow.</p>
<p>The years since 1914 had turned many things upside down. World War I had
devastated Europe and opened up a set of challenges from radical
anticapitalist movements that wanted to transform the world in a
collectivist direction. In the colonial countries, resistance was
brewing. The United States had become the world's most powerful country,
but, except in an economic sense, it was uncertain of its global role.
The ideological Cold War, Communism versus capitalism, had intensified,
but it had not yet created a bipolar international system of opposing
states. By 1941 it was Nazi Germany, driven by an aggressive nationalist
ideology, that seemed to benefit most from this state of affairs. But
while the Germans had reached most of their European objectives, they
had not managed to knock Britain and the USSR out of the war. The two
holdouts, diametrically opposed as they were in ideological orientation,
would now make an alliance of convenience that would defeat their
wartime enemies and redraw the map of the world.

<p>World War II, which lasted six years, set the framework for half a
century of Cold War. For much of the war, the Soviets, the British, and
the Americans were allies. But the defeat of their common
enemies---Germany, Italy, and Japan---meant that the conflict between
Communism, led by the Soviet Union, and its opponents, led by the United
States, became the new central focus of world politics. The dramatic
loss in status and influence of the two main European colonial empires,
first the French and then the British, led to the United States becoming
by far the world's most powerful country. The outcome of World War II
assured American global hegemony, with the Soviet Union and the
Communist parties it had inspired as the only major challenge remaining.</p>
<p>While it is important to understand the role of World War II in creating
the Cold War international system, it is equally important not to reduce
that great war only to a prelude for what was to come. From a US
perspective, World War II was predominantly about defeating German and
Japanese expansionism in Europe and Asia. But even so, the question
often asked---why was there later a Cold War when the United States and
the USSR could be allies in World War II?---is the wrong question. The
two were accidental allies in a global war brought on by their mutual
enemies. In June 1941 Germany had attacked the USSR, and that December
Japan attacked the United States. The Grand Alliance between the USSR,
the United States, and Great Britain did not consist of a long period of
working together for common aims, as most successful alliances do. It
was a set of shotgun marriages brought on by real need, at a time when
each of them had to find help to defeat immediate threats.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-44}Winston Churchill, British prime minister
since 1940, gave voice to this dilemma when he addressed the nation via
radio after the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa,
on 22 June 1941. Never even mentioning the Soviets or Stalin by name,
Churchill still declared a de facto alliance with Moscow:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
The Nazi regime is indistinguishable from the worst features of
Communism... [and] no-one has been a more consistent opponent of
Communism than I have for the last twenty-five years. I will unsay no
words that I've spoken about it. But all this fades away before the
spectacle which is now unfolding. The past, with its crimes, its follies
and its tragedies, flashes away. I see the Russian soldiers standing on
the threshold of their native land.... It follows, therefore, that we
shall give whatever help we can to Russia and to the Russian people....
[Hitler's] invasion of Russia is no more than a prelude to an
attempted invasion of the British
Isles.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en033en">^1^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en033}
:::</p>
<p>Stalin knew that his regime was very lucky to receive foreign aid. Just
as he had expected uprisings against his dictatorship across the Soviet
Union after the German surprise attack, he had expected Britain and the
United States to concentrate on their own defense and leave Russia to
its fate. Stalin's views were not surprising. Not only had his pact with
Hitler helped unleash World War II, but---shielded by the pact---his
forces had invaded eastern Poland, occupied the Baltic states, and
attacked Finland. European memories of the peak of Soviet terror in the
1930s were still fresh, as was intelligence information about Soviet
supplies of fuel and oil to the Germans in 1939 and 1940. In 1941 there
was ample reason not only for conservatives, but for liberals and Social
Democrats as well, to see Hitler and Stalin as two thieves in the same
market, two dictators leading cruel regimes, which were the deadly
enemies not only of free market capitalism but of independent workers'
organizations and of representative democracy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-45}But foreign leaders realized that the only
chance for Britain to survive the war, barring a US entry, was for the
Soviets to resist the German forces as long as possible. And for that to
happen, the USSR had to receive British and American support and aid. As
Churchill quipped to his private secretary on the day of the invasion,
"If Hitler invaded Hell I would make at least a favorable reference to
the Devil in the House of
Commons."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en034en">^2^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en034} As it
turned out, Churchill (and Roosevelt) would say much more positive
things about Stalin and the Soviet regime later in the war than anyone
could have expected in the summer of 1941. But in that crucial year all
that mattered was the ability of the Red Army to continue to fight.
British military leaders, however, had little belief in Soviet military
capabilities. The chief of the Imperial General Staff told the prime
minister that "I suppose they will be rounded up in
hordes."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en035en">^3^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en035} And to
begin with they were. By the winter of 1941--42 the unified armed forces
of Nazi Germany, the Wehrmacht, had taken 3.5 million Soviet prisoners.
Behind German lines many civilians collaborated freely, especially in
the Baltic states and in Ukraine, where significant portions of the
population saw the German occupation as a liberation from Soviet rule.
Atrocities against Jews were common. Hitler equated Bolshevism with
Jewish rule and called his war against Stalin a "crusade to save Europe"
from a Judeo-Bolshevik threat. Romanian, Hungarian, Croatian, Slovak,
Finnish, and Spanish forces joined the Germans in the first months of
the offensive.</p>
<p>The German attack on the Soviet Union also brought Britain and the
United States closer together. Roosevelt regarded (rightly, based on
past performance) his new British colleague as a jingoist and buffoon,
who would not be an easy partner for any foreign nation. But FDR also
realized, very quickly, that Churchill would fight to the bitter end
against Nazi Germany. There would be no surrender. Meanwhile, FDR
himself, increasingly concerned with attacks on his anti-Nazi policies
within the United States, which he interpreted in a deeply partisan way
as a continuation of his political opponents' battles against the New
Deal, was willing to nail his colors to the mast of the British ship. By
dedicating his Administration's foreign policy to the survival of
Britain by any means other than direct US military intervention,
Roosevelt could get back at his domestic political enemies for being
unpatriotic or worse. The Lend-Lease agreements with London, signed into
law on 11 March 1941, put the almost limitless US industrial production
capacity at the disposal of the UK war effort. It was war by any other
means than the use of US soldiers in Europe. From 1941 to 1945, the
United States delivered \$31 billion (close to half a trillion in 2016
dollars) worth of equipment to the United Kingdom: ships, aircraft, oil,
and food. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union, FDR extended
Lend-Lease there. "We are at the moment," Churchill and Roosevelt told
Stalin in a joint telegram, "cooperating to provide you with the very
maximum of supplies that you most urgently need. Already many shiploads
have left our shores and more will leave in the immediate
future."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en036en">^4^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en036}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-46}In September 1941, after three months of
war on the Eastern Front, most observers still expected the Soviet Union
to collapse, either through a military breakdown or through internal
uprisings, just like in 1917. A couple of months later they were no
longer so sure. The defense of Moscow and Leningrad, organized by Stalin
and his generals, was tenacious. The German supply lines were
overextended and their losses increased. German racial policies made it
difficult to recruit from among the local populations. Hitler's
murderous obsession with exterminating Jews and Communists in the vast
occupied areas deflected from the German military advance. And winter
was setting in, with temperatures down to forty degrees below. The
German soldiers had not prepared to fight under such conditions. Hitler
had told them that the offensive would be over quickly, as had happened
against France.</p>
<p>When the Germans failed to defeat the Soviets in the fall of 1941, the
international situation changed fundamentally. A sudden invasion of
Britain became much less likely. In occupied Europe, people began to
hope that Germany could after all be defeated. Germany's allies and
friends in Europe---Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Spain---were
discouraged, and some of their leaders began to wonder about how to
settle with the British or with the Soviets.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-47}But the biggest impact of the stalemate on
the Eastern Front was on Japan. No longer believing that the Soviet
Union would collapse or even be an easy target for their forces, Tokyo
reoriented its aggressive strategy southward and eastward. Its own war
with China had been dragging on for four years. Japanese leaders now
decided to land a devastating blow to European interests in Asia and
secure access for itself to crucial southeast Asian raw materials.</p>
<p>In December 1941, the Japanese attack on the main US naval base in
Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, and on European colonies in Asia meant that
American forces joined in the fighting in the east and soon also in
Europe. Even though the US Navy's top strategists had been deeply
concerned with the Japanese naval buildup in the Pacific, nobody had
expected an all-out attack on US facilities. What followed was even more
shocking. Within six months, Japan had taken control of all of southeast
Asia and stood at the gates of British India. In the wake of the
victories of its Japanese allies, Germany rashly declared war on the
United States. The Axis Powers, as Germany and its partners were called,
now controlled most of Europe and much of Asia. But through their
reckless pursuit of power, they had also brought together against them
the most powerful coalition of forces the world had ever seen.</p>
<p>The US stock-taking of its new Soviet allies was important for what was
to follow. Britain was a known quantity in the United States. Although
many Americans disliked the British for their class system, their
colonialism, and their snobbish way of looking down their noses at
"upstart" former colonials in North America, a common language and
common cultural and political traditions linked them. The Soviet Union
was very different. Having entered the war, many Americans hoped that
the common cause would help make the Soviets more "democratic" and the
Soviet Union more like the United States. US government propaganda
presented an image of heroic Russians fighting a devilish enemy. For
some Left-wingers, in the United States as elsewhere, the Soviet and
then the American entry into the war, involuntary as they may both have
been, was an enormous relief, and held out hopes for a future in which
the two countries could work together both to defeat Hitler and to build
a better world. Woody Guthrie, who had lost his first radio job for
refusing to condemn Stalin over the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact,
now could sing about taking his union gun into battle and ending a world
of slavery: "You're bound to lose / You Fascists bound to
lose!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en037en">^5^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en037}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-48}The Fascists may have been bound to lose.
But the three newfound allies approached each other warily. In Stalin's
mind, there was no fundamental difference between Britain and the United
States, on the one hand, and Hitler and the Japanese on the other. Any
alliance with ideological enemies would be temporary and brittle, Stalin
thought, and would only survive as long as the others needed the Soviet
Union for their own purposes. Even with the United States in the war,
Stalin expected his capitalist allies at some point to seek a separate
peace with Nazi Germany, leaving his Communist country in the
lurch.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en038en">^6^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en038} As
Stalin's Red Army slowly began to push back the German divisions, at
tremendous cost in lives and materiel, the Soviet leader constantly
demanded that his allies set up a second front against Germany in
northwest Europe. The fact that he did not get it until June 1944, after
nine million Soviet soldiers had been killed, was to Stalin proof of
British and American perfidy and hostility.</p>
<p>But if Stalin distrusted and disparaged his allies, the Soviet Union was
increasingly dependent on their support for its survival. In all, goods
and weapons worth \$11.3 billion (\$180 billion in 2016 dollars) reached
the USSR between June 1941 and September 1945. Five thousand sailors
died in shipping the aid to Soviet harbors. Some of this materiel was
crucial to the Soviet war effort. Locomotives and railcars helped
transport troops. Dodge trucks became the mainstay of Soviet logistics
in their great tank battles both against Germany and later against
Japan. Canned rations produced in Ohio and Nebraska kept millions of
Soviets from starvation. Stalin thought, not unreasonably, that the
Soviets paid for these supplies in blood on the battlefield. But he also
knew that the American supplies were of such great importance to the Red
Army's fighting capabilities that he could not under any circumstance
endanger their continued provision. Stalin therefore had a very concrete
motive for continuing to cooperate with his allies as long as the war
lasted and, if possible, for the long period of time it would take to
rebuild the Soviet Union after the war ended.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-49}The main political negotiations among the
allies during the war took place at a number of summit meetings. At
Tehran in November 1943, Yalta in February 1945, and Potsdam in July
1945, the leaders of the three major Allied powers participated. But in
addition there were a number of bilateral meetings: Churchill traveled
to meet Roosevelt three times before the prime minister's first visit to
Moscow in August 1942. Churchill's visit with Stalin was essential. If
the head of world Communism and the dyed-in-the-wool anti-Communist
could reach practical agreements, then the alliance between the three
incongruous partners would probably hold, at least for the duration of
the war against Germany. The positive outcome of the first meeting in
Moscow showed the degree to which Britain and the USSR, both struck by
German power, depended on some form of cooperation for survival. But
during their conversations, Stalin passed up few opportunities to chide
his ally for British (and US) lack of a land offensive against Germany.
According to British minutes of an August 1942 meeting at the Kremlin,
"Stalin suggested that higher sacrifices were called for. Ten thousand
men a day were being sacrificed on the Russian front.... The Russians
did not complain of the sacrifices they were making, but the extent of
them should be
recognised."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en039en">^7^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en039}</p>
<p>At the Tehran summit in November 1943, a pattern was set that would last
until the war was over. The Soviet role had changed from supplicant to
demander. In January 1943 the Red Army had broken the German offensive
at Stalingrad. From the summer of 1943, Soviet forces were on the attack
along several broad fronts toward eastern Europe. The often-promised
second front in France had not happened, even though Allied forces had
landed in Italy in September. On the Asian side, Japan was still on the
offensive in China, while US forces were slowly pushing Japan's Imperial
Army back across the Pacific. Most importantly, by the end of 1943 the
United States had mobilized fully for war both in Asia and in Europe. In
the year to come, the United States would produce 300,000 military
planes and 529 large warships. Germany's production was 133,000 and 20;
Japan's, 70,000 and 90. In the first three months of 1943 the United
States produced as much overall shipping tonnage as Japan did in total
during seven years of war. The Soviet Union was on the offensive in
Europe, but the country itself was devastated. The United States was
untouched, and its GDP had almost doubled since 1939.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-50}In their discussions at Tehran, Stalin
attempted to set the agenda because he knew that the Americans now
wanted something from him. A Soviet attack on Japan could save hundreds
of thousands of American soldiers' lives in the Pacific, not to mention
in the battles that would follow an invasion of the Japanese home
islands. Roosevelt also had his mind set on a postwar world
organization---what became the United Nations---in which he wanted
Soviet participation. Given the increasing weakness of the British
economic and political position, many of the key points of the
conference were settled by Stalin and Roosevelt without Churchill's
direct participation. On the afternoon of 1 December 1943 Stalin came to
see Roosevelt in the US president's quarters in the Soviet embassy in
Tehran, into which FDR had moved for security reasons. In their
conversation, the US president agreed to move Poland's borders two
hundred miles west, at the expense of Germany, and keep the eastern
borders for Poland that Stalin and Hitler had agreed to in 1939. FDR
also agreed to the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet
Union. He only asked Stalin to keep the deal secret, so that it would
not adversely affect his chances for reelection in 1944. FDR believed
that little could be done for these countries anyway; at the end of the
war the Red Army would be in control of their territories unless Britain
and the United States were willing to fight the Soviets over them (which
they were not).<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en040en">^8^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en040}
Roosevelt got Stalin's agreement to enter the war against Japan after
the defeat of
Germany.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en041en">^9^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en041}</p>
<p>When the Yalta summit was held in February 1945, the military situation
had changed even more in the Soviets' favor. Budapest fell to the Red
Army during the conference. Soviet advance forces ended up standing less
than seventy miles from Berlin as the conference was still going on.
Even so, Yalta was not an all-out victory for Soviet interests.
Roosevelt, physically weakened by illness, got Stalin to repeat his firm
commitment to enter the war in east Asia no later than three months
after the defeat of Germany. He also got Soviet membership in the new
world organization he had proposed, the United Nations. Churchill, on
his side, got the creation of a French occupation zone in postwar
Germany, although the Soviets and the Americans had opposed it before
the conference. The British wanted it because they sought to restore
France's position as a Great Power, in order to fortify against postwar
Soviet control in Europe after a US withdrawal. Stalin got little that
he had not achieved by military force already. The Allies agreed to
build on a Communist-based Polish government, already in place in Warsaw
after the Red Army occupation, not on the Polish government-in-exile
based in London. The Soviets would be compensated for their efforts in
Asia by getting some of their prerevolutionary rights in northeastern
China (Manchuria) returned to them. The Chinese had not been asked their
opinion in the matter.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-51}A major Soviet concession, at least in the
eyes of Roosevelt and Churchill, was agreeing to a joint Declaration on
Liberated Europe. But the declaration was long on principle and short on
detail. It promised the peoples of Europe the right to "create
democratic institutions of their own choice" and "to choose the form of
government under which they will live," including "the earliest possible
establishment through free elections of Governments responsive to the
will of the people." It also talked about "the restoration of sovereign
rights and self-government to those peoples who have been forcibly
deprived of
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en042en">^10^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en042} The
American and British leaders expected the Soviets to at least go through
the motions of "democracy" and "elections" in the parts of Europe
occupied by the Red Army. It was more than a fig leaf. Leaders in London
and Washington needed these concessions both for their own public
opinion and as a sign of trust among allies. But they did not think they
could alter the facts on the ground in eastern Europe. "It is the best I
can do for Poland at this time," FDR told his advisers at
Yalta.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en043en">^11^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en043} Churchill
went further. As he told his Cabinet after returning from the Crimea,
"Stalin I'm sure means well to the world and Poland" and would deliver
the "Polish people [a] free and more broadly-based gov[ernmen]t to
bring about [an]
election."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en044en">^12^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en044}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-52}Even battle-hardened politicians can give
in to wishful thinking as a long war is coming to an end. Roosevelt and
Churchill wanted peace after the war, and they hoped Stalin would help
them deliver that peace. But their oversell of the Yalta agreements in
their own countries increased the risk of conflict rather than reduced
it. Stalin had no intention of allowing Western-style elections in
Poland. After occupying the eastern part of the country in 1940, his
secret police had executed twenty-two thousand Polish officers,
policemen, officials, landowners, factory owners, lawyers, and priests
and buried them in mass graves, such as at Katyn. The Soviets knew that
any elections in Poland would produce an overwhelming majority against
them and the government they had created. But the problem was not only
the Soviet relationship with Poland. The Stalin who signed the
declaration on democracy and national rights in Europe was the same man
who had launched a new democratic constitution for the USSR in 1936, the
year in which his regime executed at least three hundred thousand of its
own citizens. He was the same man who was purported to have written a
theoretical book on Marxism and the "national question," full of
nice-sounding phrases, while sending whole nations to exile or death.
The point was not so much that Stalin could not be trusted. The point
was that the Soviet regime could not have introduced democratic
elections in eastern Europe even if it had wanted to. It was not of that
kind.</p>
<p>Stalin learned quickly how to conduct war on a grand scale, even if he
left most of the concrete planning to his generals. Because of the
ferocity of the German attack, the Soviet leader believed (for the first
and only time) that Russian officers were (by necessity) loyal to him
and the Communist regime, and he started a massive campaign of Russian
nationalist propaganda in order to keep things that way, at least for
the duration of the war. The word "revolution" was replaced by "nation"
in Communist self-promotion; it is not for nothing that Russians still
know World War II as the Great Patriotic War. It is hard to know whether
Stalin's own views changed much. His megalomania certainly grew. More
than ever before, the Soviet Union became an instrument of his personal
power. It is also clear that Stalin relished the personal recognition
that his alliance brought him. To be dealt with on equal terms by a
British aristocrat and the president of the most powerful country on
earth was pleasing to a former bank robber from small-town Georgia. But
Stalin's wartime interaction with his allies did not change his outlook
on the world, which remained crudely Marxist. Those who benefitted from
capitalism, he thought, would always oppose the Soviet experiment and
try to extinguish it. Therefore there would be conflict, including wars,
between the Soviets and their opponents in the future. For now, however,
all that mattered was the survival of Soviet power in the USSR and, if
militarily possible, its extension into central Europe. Communist
revolutions in Europe could wait, Stalin thought, until the European
peoples were ready for them. The view in Moscow in 1945 was that the Red
Army could further such revolutions, but it could not guarantee them.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-53}Stalin hoped that his alliance with the
United States and Britain would last for several years after the war
ended. His country was a disaster in 1945. The physical destruction was
immense, as were the human losses. Stalin knew that the Soviet Union
needed peace if it was to recover. He feared the consequences for his
own party if people were forced to live in misery even after the war was
over. But Stalin was never quite sure what peace really meant, or
whether his and Communism's international opponents were willing to let
him rest. There was no opposition to his dictatorship in the Soviet
Union, and Stalin had a hard time imagining any opposition coming out of
the new regions his Red Army had conquered. These countries might not be
ripe for Communism yet, he thought, but they could be guided toward it
by his authority and the example of the Soviet state. The British and
Americans would extend their form of capitalism into the heart of
Europe. Stalin would, at least over time, attempt to do the same with
his system. It was both an ideological and strategic imperative. "This
war," Stalin told his Yugoslav Communist admirers in April 1945, "is not
as in the past; whoever occupies a territory also imposes on it his own
social system. Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can
reach. It cannot be
otherwise."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en045en">^13^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en045}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-54}For ordinary Russians, the Great Patriotic
War meant that Stalin and the Communist Party became symbols for the
defense of the country. In the 1930s Stalin may have symbolized
modernization, social justice, and the welding together of the Soviet
Union into a new kind of state, but he and his henchmen were still
outsiders. One, whom I later spoke to, told me about their sense of
having stolen a country and got away with it. In a 1933 poem, Osip
Mandelstam had described the <em>vozhd</em> as "the Kremlin's mountain yokel."
Perhaps it was the line "the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip"
that cost the poet his life. But many shared his sense of insult at a
"foreign" regime led by a Georgian imposing its authority on
Russians.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en046en">^14^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en046} The
ferocity of the German attack, Hitler's policy of extermination in the
occupied areas, and, maybe most importantly, the ability of the Soviet
regime to fight foreign invaders, had changed much of that. In 1945
Stalin's dictatorship could be seen as representing the Russian nation
simply through having fought, and in the end defeated, the German
invasion. Even the Russian Orthodox Church---an institution for which
the original Bolshevik approach in 1917 had been to burn its churches,
if possible with worshippers inside---blessed the Soviet regime in 1945.
"The Russian people accepted this war as a holy war," said one of the
church leaders, "a war for their faith and for their country....
Patriotism and Orthodoxy are
one."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en047en">^15^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en047}</p>
<p>The pride of the Russians in the victory over Nazi Germany was also
reflected in how others viewed the Soviets. In many parts of Europe the
Red Army was seen as the real liberator of the continent from Nazi rule.
In northern Norway, where Soviet troops entered in 1945, fishermen and
their families emerged from hiding with banners praising Stalin and the
Red Army. In Czechoslovakia, which had suffered six long years of German
occupation, people embraced the Soviet soldiers as they marched through.
In eastern Europe, many saw the Red Army as a Slav army liberating them
from German racial oppression. But even outside their zones of
occupation, Stalin and the Soviets were hailed as the liberators of the
continent. In France, quite a few who had condemned Communism in the
1930s now saw it in a more positive light because of the amount of
Soviet sacrifice in the war against Hitler. Support for Communist
parties in western Europe had never been greater. Most of the new
Communists were young people who had come of age during the war. In
their eyes Communism and the Soviet example were first and foremost
about much-needed reform in their home countries. They wanted full
employment and social services. Women who had joined the workforce
during the war did not want to be forced back into patriarchal
domesticity. Communists were genuinely admired by many for their role in
the resistance to German occupation, including by people who regretted
their own failure at taking up weapons. Now Nazism and Fascism were
dead, and Europe could renew itself. In spite of the Soviets' bloody
past, Communism had a model ready for Europe's transformation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-55}The sense of the need for change was also
very visible outside of Europe as World War II was coming to an end. If
the First World War had sounded the death knell for Europe's world
domination, the Second World War made its abolition a necessity, not
least for Europeans themselves. Young people in Europe who had survived
the war were far more preoccupied with welfare in their own countries
than in what happened to their colonies. Crucially, large numbers of
them no longer believed that their own income and status were dependent
on the maintenance of colonial control overseas. At the same time
anticolonial resistance was on the increase, especially in Asia. Reeling
from the war against Germany and Japanese attacks in the east, in 1942
Britain had offered India self-government as soon as the war was over.
But independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, known as the Mahatma, or "Great
Soul," refused to budge on his demand for immediate independence. In
1942 he launched the Quit India Movement, which aimed at making use of
British wartime weakness to drive them out of the subcontinent. Gandhi
wanted no compromise. Churchill's offers "have shown up British
imperialism in its nakedness as never before," Gandhi wrote. The British
"desire our help only as slaves... it is harmful to India's interests,
and dangerous to the cause of India's freedom, to introduce foreign
soldiers in India," even to fight Hitler and the
Japanese.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en048en">^16^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en048}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-56}Further east, colonialism also seemed in
free fall. In Indonesia---a new territorial concept coined by
nationalists for all the southern islands of southeast Asia, as well as
Malay-speaking regions of the mainland---the anticolonial leader Sukarno
worked with the Japanese occupiers to secure independence from the
Netherlands. In Vietnam, also a new term for all Viet-speaking regions
that had been colonized by France, the Communist Ho Chi Minh established
an independent state, with himself as president. The US government had
promised the Philippines its independence before the war and used the
promise to mobilize against the Japanese occupation of the islands. In
Iran and Egypt nationalists protested against imposed British control.
For many people in these countries, Nazism and Japan were not the main
problems. The problem was European colonialism in all its forms. Working
with Berlin and Tokyo could even help hasten the day of independence and
national self-determination. The Atlantic Charter, issued by Roosevelt
and Churchill in August 1941, seemed to some non-European nationalists
too reminiscent of Woodrow Wilson's World War I idealism, even if it
inspired others. In the charter, the two countries pledged to "respect
the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which
they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self
government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en049en">^17^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en049} This,
Indian, Indonesian, and Algerian nationalists claimed, must be as true
for their countries as it would be for such white European countries as
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and France.</p>
<p>For most Americans, the Atlantic Charter summed up the principles for
which they fought. The United States had been attacked by Japan and
Germany, they thought, because these countries' leaders hated the
principles to which America had dedicated itself. World War II, in the
American view, was a battle for individual liberty, constitutional
order, and the American way of life. As in World War I, it was the
enemies of these principles who had unleashed global war, and the United
States had yet again to sacrifice the lives of its young men to attempt
to set the rest of the world right. Toward the end of World War II,
there was in America, across the political spectrum, a deeply felt sense
that the country had earned the right to lead by example and that the
world needed to be reformed along US lines if yet another war was to be
avoided.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-57}The growing US impatience with being
challenged on any major issue even by its allies was in part a
reflection of American power as the war was ending. The United States
had outproduced and outfought its enemies. By mid-1945 the US Navy was
bigger than all the world's other navies combined, and US bombers had
devastated Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, and Yokohama. As the war ended, more
than 60 percent of all the world's heavy aircraft were American. No
enemy bombers ever hit the US mainland. Both because of its productive
power and because it was untouched by warfare, the US economy in 1945
reigned supreme. It now accounted for more than half of the world's
manufacturing capacity. It held two-thirds of the total financial
reserves available, providing it with the world's only stable currency
and therefore the one in which all global trade was denominated.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt had no grand plan for what the world ought
to look like after the war had ended. When he died, suddenly, on 12
April 1945, his focus was still squarely on fighting the war. The
conflict in Europe had not yet ended, although German military power was
fading fast. Japan showed no sign of surrendering. Roosevelt still
wanted a Soviet entry into the war against Japan in order to spare
American lives if an invasion of the Japanese home islands should be
necessary. Supremely self-confident to the last, FDR had no doubts that
he would be able to manage his relations with his allies as the war came
to an end, and after that, too. In spite of rising tension with the
Soviets, especially over the future of Poland, Roosevelt was convinced
that the wartime alliance would muddle through, not least because of his
own charisma, political suaveness, and ability to avoid overall
confrontation (sometimes through being economical with the truth, both
to his allies and his own people). Political defeat at home, not to
mention death, simply did not figure in his calculations.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-58}Because FDR had managed to transmit this
confidence in his own durability, if not immortality, to his
Administration, Vice President Harry S. Truman had the worst day of his
life as he was sworn in as president upon Roosevelt's sudden demise. The
new US president had been abroad only once, seeing combat as a captain
in France during World War I, and FDR had never drawn him into any
foreign policy decision-making. Now Truman suddenly had to take charge
of the most powerful country on earth just as the war was ending. Like
his predecessor, the new president believed that the Grand Alliance
would remain in place after the defeat of Germany, but he lacked the
tools FDR had counted on to make it happen: personal charm, strategic
(and moral) flexibility, and knowledge of world affairs. Down-to-earth,
middle-class Truman was, in other words, closer both to the behavior and
the outlook of most of his countrymen than his patrician predecessor had
been. He was also more convinced that the United States had the power to
set things right, and with that conviction came an impatience when being
challenged. Both FDR and Truman disliked Communism, but from the very
beginning of his presidency, the new president saw Communism as a
challenge to the United States, as an undesired alternative to a US-led
world order. Truman wanted to strike deals with Stalin, but only if the
latter behaved according to a US view of how the world was supposed to
operate.</p>
<p>Hitler committed suicide on 30 April and Germany capitulated
unconditionally on 7 May 1945. With the Führer dead and the country in
ruins, Hitler's generals had nothing left to fight for. The endgame had
come quickly, with Soviet forces rushing in from the east and US and
British forces from the west and south. While all sides attempted to end
up in control of as much land as possible, as long as the war lasted
military considerations generally overrode the competition for
territory. US and Soviet soldiers hugged and drank together, teaching
each other songs from home, when they first met up by the River Elbe
north of Leipzig. It would take more than forty years for Americans and
Soviets to be able to mingle so effortlessly again.</p>
<p>The heads of the three main victorious states met outside Berlin, the
capital of defeated Germany, from 17 July to 2 August 1945. At the small
town of Potsdam, where the Prussian kings had their summer palaces,
Stalin yet again played the host, as he had at Yalta and Tehran. But
even if it was Soviet forces who had taken the German capital, Stalin
wanted to avoid a clash with his allies over the occupation regime in
Germany. At Potsdam the Soviet leader mainly wanted US and British
acceptance of his country's predominant position in eastern Europe. Both
Roosevelt and Churchill had given him reason to believe that would be
the case. But at Potsdam, Stalin was the only constant of the three
leaders. When the meeting convened, FDR was dead, and Truman took his
place. During the conference, the Conservatives lost the British general
elections to the Labour Party, so on July 26 Prime Minister Clement
Attlee replaced Churchill in Potsdam. Stalin distrusted Truman and
Attlee from the beginning---Truman because Soviet intelligence reports
stressed his anti-Communism and Attlee because he represented the Right
wing of the British Labour movement, the old enemies of Communists
everywhere. The Soviet leader knew, however, that he held two trump
cards. His troops occupied half of Europe. And the war in east Asia was
still not over. The new US president, like the old one, needed Soviet
assistance to defeat Japan.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-59}The Potsdam Conference is testimony to how
fast global events can move, especially when a great war is coming to an
end. The participants were not much preoccupied with Germany. Hitler was
dead and his country defeated. The agreement on temporary zones of
occupation, demilitarization and denazification, reversal of all German
annexations, and moving Polish borders west at Germany's expense (so
that Stalin could keep his conquests of 1939) were easily arrived at.
Tehran and Yalta had set the pattern on these matters, and Stalin was
secretly relieved to find that those agreements still stood. The
attention of all three main participants had moved to war in east Asia
and to the political settlements in liberated Europe. Stalin knew that
Truman's eagerness to get the USSR into the war against Japan would help
with other matters, maybe also in Europe. The US development of nuclear
weapons, which Truman alluded to during their conversations, came as no
surprise to Stalin; his spies had been following the US development of
the atomic bomb since 1942. There is no evidence that the Soviet leader
felt threatened by the US atomic monopoly in 1945, even though it made
him speed up his own nuclear program. The Red Army had ten million
soldiers in Europe, though Stalin, prior to Potsdam, had started
transferring troops to east Asia in preparation for an attack on Japan.
Stalin had just survived the biggest war in human history and emerged as
its victor. He may have had forebodings about the future (he always
did), but at Potsdam he was brimming with self-confidence and gusto.
Truman believed he could take the measure of the man, and that
negotiations with the Soviets were possible. "I can deal with Stalin,"
the new president confided to his diary. "He is honest---but smart as
hell."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en050en">^18^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en050}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-60}The Potsdam Conference spent a great deal
of time avoiding making decisions for the future. It was a waiting game:
the war in Asia was still on, Truman and Attlee were new in power, and
Stalin wanted to solidify the gains he had already made on the
battlefield in Europe and, as a consequence thereof, at Tehran and
Yalta. The British and Americans expected elections in Soviet-occupied
eastern Europe and at least a pro forma adhesion to principles of
democracy there. But at the moment the material challenges of the peace
were enormous. All across the continent, great masses of people who had
fled from the war were trying to get back home. Big cities were in
ruins. Millions had no food or fuel. It is not surprising that there was
a general feeling that political resolutions could wait. But while
leaders hesitated on the big issues, decisions were being made on the
ground, in part as a result of conflicting visions of how societies
should be reorganized after the war had ended.</p>
<p><strong>T[HESE CONTESTS HAPPENED]{.small-caps}</strong> throughout Europe, but it
could still be argued that the Cold War began in Poland. There, Stalin's
policy of imposing strict Soviet control clashed with the wishes of his
allies and those of the great majority of Poles. Britain had gone to war
with Germany over the fate of Poland in 1939, and it would be hard for
any British government to accept Soviet occupation and dictatorship in
that country. Churchill was led by the exigencies of war and a great
deal of wishful thinking about Stalin's intentions to accept the Soviet
plan for a reorganization of the Polish government over the heads of the
Poles themselves. But this was only a first step in the Soviet campaign
to bring Poland to heel. When the Poles had rebelled against the Germans
in Warsaw in the summer of 1944, the Red Army deliberately stopped its
offensive outside the Polish capital, allowing the Nazis to destroy the
Polish Home Army. Stalin reckoned that the fewer Polish officers alive,
the better for Soviet control of the country. When the Red Army was
finally ordered to take Warsaw, a quarter of a million Poles had already
been killed by the Wehrmacht and the SS and most of the city had been
razed to the ground. Even so, after entering the Polish capital,
Stalin's secret police kidnapped many of the surviving leaders of the
resistance and shipped them off to Moscow for a typical Stalinist show
trial. Stalin had instructed the Soviet judges to give them "light"
sentences, as a favor to his great power allies. All but a few were to
die in captivity anyway.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-61}As all of this went on in Warsaw, US views
of Soviet behavior started to change. Roosevelt had become increasingly
concerned with the Polish issue; his main concern had been the disdain
for foreign opinion with which the Soviets handled matters in Warsaw.
His successor saw matters in more concrete terms. Harry Truman believed
that the Yalta agreements on Poland ensured democratic freedom and an
inclusive transition government that would prepare free elections. The
Soviets were not living up to their commitments, Truman thought. As a
result, the new president's first meeting with Soviet foreign minister
Viacheslav Molotov, twelve days after FDR's death and three months
before Potsdam, had been quite frosty. "The President said that he
desired the friendship of the Soviet Government," reads the official US
record, "but that he felt it could only be on the basis of mutual
observation of agreements and not on the basis of a one way
street."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en051en">^19^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en051} "I gave
it to him straight," Truman told a friend afterward. "I let him have it.
It was the straight one-two to the
jaw."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en052en">^20^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en052}</p>
<p>Poland seemed a dividing line to Allied leaders. Churchill, who had less
at stake in the final stages of the war in Asia, moved effortlessly back
to some of his earlier views of the Soviets. On 12 May Churchill sent
Truman a personal message, in which for the first time a western leader
used a term that would define the Cold War, "Iron Curtain":</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-62}An iron curtain is drawn down upon [the
Soviet] front. We do not know what is going on behind. There seems
little doubt that the whole of the regions east of the line
Lubeck--Trieste--Corfu will soon be completely in their hands... as this
enormous Muscovite advance into the centre of Europe takes place.... It
would be open to the Russians in a very short time to advance if they
chose to the waters of the North Sea and the Atlantic.... Surely it is
vital now to come to an understanding with Russia, or see where we are
with her, before we weaken our armies mortally or retire to the zones of
occupation.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en053en">^21^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en053}
:::</p>
<p>Increasingly concerned about Soviet behavior in the east, Churchill
wanted US and British troops to remain in the positions they had had
when the war ended. Truman turned him down, ordering a withdrawal to
conform with the lines of responsibility previously agreed with the
Soviets. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Germans fled west to
avoid the Soviet zone of occupation. But Truman was concerned enough to
send Harry Hopkins, FDR's trusted adviser and a champion of cooperation
with the Soviets, to Moscow to try to convince Stalin of the error of
his ways. Hopkins was already dying of cancer, and the grueling trip to
Russia took the best out of him. He still tried his hand with the Soviet
dictator, though. "I told Stalin," Hopkins reported to Truman, "that I
personally felt that our relations were threatened and that I frankly
had many misgivings about it and with my intimate knowledge of the
situation I was, frankly, bewildered with some of the things that were
going on."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en054en">^22^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en054}
Stalin would not budge. He accused the British of muddying the waters in
US-Soviet relations. Even though mainly conceived as part of US postwar
cost-cutting, Truman's abrupt termination of the Lend-Lease arrangements
with the Soviet Union right after victory in Europe in May 1945 had also
helped convince Stalin that he was facing a new attitude in Washington.
He did not know whether it was the end of the war in Europe or the
coming of a new president that had caused it. Stalin had been on his
best behavior at Potsdam. But his suspicions were up. "Poland! What a
big deal!" Soviet foreign minister Molotov noted in February 1945. "We
are unaware," Molotov continued, "of how the governments in Belgium,
France, Germany, etc. are organized. No one consulted us, although we
don't say we like one or another of these governments. We didn't
interfere because this is the zone of operations of British and American
troops!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en055en">^23^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en055}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-63}In the rest of eastern Europe, which lay
within the Soviet lines of occupation, Stalin's irritation with his
Great Power partners showed more clearly. In Bulgaria he accepted a more
radical line from the local Communists in early 1945; hundreds of key
opponents of the Communist-led Fatherland Front, which ruled the country
after the Red Army invaded, were executed and more than ten thousand
sentenced to prison terms. Most of these had served in Bulgaria's
wartime government, which had been an ally of Hitler's Germany. Neither
the Allies nor most of the Bulgarian public therefore protested much.
But these were not trials of collaborators as seen in western Europe. In
Bulgaria, the Soviets and local Communists established a pattern in
which all opposition to Communist control of the government was by its
very nature defined as Fascist and therefore subject to imprisonment or
worse. Inside the Soviet Union, more than a million Balts and
Caucasians, including the whole Chechen population, were deported to
Siberia and to the Russian Far East as the war came to an end. The
Soviet regime did not want to take any chances with unreliable
population groups in its border areas.</p>
<p>Stalin did not have a master plan for what to do in eastern Europe when
the war was over. But the Communists there were loyal only to him and
provided the ultimate guarantee for Soviet control if relations with the
United States and Britain were to break down. And in the spring of 1945
Stalin increasingly fell back on what his Marxism told him about his
erstwhile allies. Already in January he had warned against believing in
any continuing community of interest between Moscow and the west. "The
crisis of capitalism has manifested itself in the division of the
capitalists into two factions---one fascist, the other democratic," he
told a group of visiting Yugoslavs and Bulgarians. "The alliance between
ourselves and the democratic faction of capitalists came about because
the latter had a stake in preventing Hitler's domination, for that
brutal state would have driven the working class to extremes and to the
overthrow of capitalism itself. We are currently allied with the one
faction against the other, but in the future we will be against the
first faction of capitalists,
too."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en056en">^24^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en056}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-64}One of the biggest surprises the Soviets
got in 1945 was the Labour Party victory in the British general
election. Stalin may have distrusted Winston Churchill and seen in him
the embodiment of British upper-class rule, but Winston was the devil he
knew, just as he knew, through his spies, that the old Conservative had
formed a bit of a sentimental relationship with Stalin as a fellow
survivor and victor in World War II. Besides, there was already bad
blood between British Labour and Soviet Bolshevism. The leaders of the
Labour Party---Clement Attlee, who now became prime minister, and Ernest
Bevin, who became foreign secretary---detested the Communists within
their own trade union movement; Moscow's supporters were responsible,
both thought, for splitting the movement in the 1920s and 1930s. Bevin,
an unskilled worker who had come to prominence as the head of the
biggest of the British trade unions, the Transport and General Workers'
Union, had fought Communist influence there and elsewhere relentlessly.
In his postwar dealings with Stalin and Molotov, Bevin saw many of these
battles repeated on an international scale. Molotov, said Bevin later,
was like a Communist in a local Labour Party branch: if you treated him
badly, he made the most of the grievance, and if you treated him well,
he put up the price next day and abused you. A cabinet colleague viewed
Bevin as "full of bright ideas, as well as earthy sense, but dangerously
obsessed with
Communists."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en057en">^25^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en057}</p>
<p>The Soviets hated British Labour back with equal fervor. In the Soviet
documents of the era, there is nearly no sense of opportunity in the
news that a Left-wing party, some of whose key union leaders and
intellectuals had long-established contacts with Moscow, had won the
British elections. Stalin and his lieutenants sensed that Labour's
dedication to building a Social Democratic welfare state could be the
worst challenge to Communist aspirations not only in Britain---none of
them were so deluded as to expect a Communist revolution in London
anytime soon---but also in the rest of western Europe. Soviet foreign
affairs experts presumed that the capitalist countries would be hit by
an economic crisis after the war ended and that competition among them
therefore would increase, as had happened after the First World War.
European Communist parties could benefit from the ensuing impoverishment
of the workers, since it would prove that no capitalist system could
deliver what the working class wanted. The efforts of Social Democrats
to reform capitalism was therefore, in the Soviet view, at best
irrelevant and at worst counterproductive. Only countries that
consciously patterned themselves on the Soviet experience, which had
shown that it could deliver full employment and economic growth, would
gain in economic terms from the war's end.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-65}The US perspective on conditions in Europe
after the war ended was almost the diametric opposite of that of the
Soviets. Americans feared the effects of an economic collapse and
lasting poverty in Europe, one that could perhaps spread worldwide.
While the Soviets expected revolution after the war, because the end of
World War I had created the Russian Revolution, most Americans feared
such revolutionary prospects. In their minds, World War I and the Great
Depression had created Communism and Fascism, the enemies of America.
Polls taken in the autumn of 1945 showed that the majority of Americans
wanted their country to act to relieve the despair and poverty that had
produced ideologies abhorrent to the American mind.</p>
<p>But American opinion polls also showed a contrary trend to this
engagement with the world. Throughout the first postwar years, the vast
majority of Americans felt their country had sacrificed enough in terms
of blood and direct effort to stem the rot in Europe and Asia. Like
Europeans and Asians, postwar Americans wanted their government to
concentrate on improving living conditions at home. Essentially they
wanted to get their boys in uniform back as quickly as possible. Fearful
of the isolationist thinking that had emerged after World War I and
mindful of the fact that the United States had not entered World War II
until it was attacked by Japan, the Truman Administration wanted to
balance the obvious need for the United States to engage internationally
after the war was over with the need to placate its voters back home. It
could do so, the president himself believed, by using its enormous
economic resources to alleviate want elsewhere and get foreign economies
going again.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-66}World War II had led to a wholesale
transformation of the global economy. As we have seen, the rise of the
United States as the center of world economic affairs had been ongoing
since the early twentieth century, and had sped up during the interwar
years. But it was World War II that made long-term change into a rapid
transformation. The American economy had almost doubled in size during
the war. In contrast, almost everywhere else lay devastated. In Japan,
across the country a quarter of all buildings were destroyed---in Tokyo
more than half. Its industrial output was below one-third of prewar
figures. In China industrial production was down by more than 60 percent
compared to 1937. In the Philippines, the Asian country most devastated
by World War II, total economic output was just above 20 percent of what
it had been in 1941.</p>
<p>During the war the Roosevelt Administration had realized that it needed
to make use of its unique position to create a postwar world that would
work better for the United States. FDR's key idea was to perpetuate the
wartime alliances against Germany and Japan, while also creating a world
organization to which all countries could belong. The United Nations, a
term that Roosevelt used interchangeably for the Allied Powers and for
the wider group of nations he wanted to put together, was founded as an
organization in 1945, with its headquarters first in London and then in
New York. In form, the UN was a compromise between two strands in the
late president's own thinking. One was idealist: to create a truly
global forum, which could assist progressive reform everywhere while
keeping the peace. The other was realist: to create a forum through
which the allied Great Powers could cooperate and, if necessary, force
others to do their bidding. The first aim was realized through the UN
General Assembly, which at the beginning had fifty-one members, among
them twenty Latin American republics. The second was constructed through
the UN Security Council, which had just five members---the United
States, Britain, the USSR, France, and China---and in which each had a
veto against any proposal made. Only the Security Council could issue
resolutions binding for all UN member states, including for sanctions or
military action. Neither Stalin nor the British had much faith in the
new organization, but each went along to please their mighty American
partner. In 1945, nobody could foresee the global role that the UN was
to play as the Cold War took hold.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-67}One of the new world organization's main
duties was to deal with global economic issues. As the most powerful
economy, the United States wanted free trade and access to markets
abroad. But it also wanted increased stability in the world economic
system. At Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in July 1944, the main allied
industrial countries had signed a set of agreements that led to the
establishment of an International Monetary Fund (IMF), to provide loans
that could bridge a country's imbalance in payments, and an
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which later
became part of the World Bank. But the most basic element of the Bretton
Woods system, as it came to be called, was tying all other major
exchange currencies to the US dollar at fixed parities. The Bretton
Woods agreements gave the United States a massive opportunity for
international trade and for influencing the economies of other
countries. But it should not be forgotten that, just like the political
division lines in Europe and Asia, the agreements were the outcome of
what the war had already created. In the longer run, the United States
got neither the opportunity nor the stability that it wanted from
Bretton Woods. But the agreements did provide a system, of sorts, to
legitimize the advent of the United States as the world's economic
behemoth.</p>
<p>Given its unique position, could the United States have done more to
avoid international conflict in the wake of World War II? A lot of
different countries resented the consequences of America's rise but
learned to live with it because they had to, for both political and
economic reasons. Lines from a ditty much circulated in the British
Foreign Office in 1945 went something like this:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-68}<em>In Washington Lord Halifax</em></p>
<p><em>Once whispered to Lord Keynes,</em></p>
<p><em>"It's true they have all the money-bags</em></p>
<p><em>But we have all the
brains."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en058en">^26^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en058}</em>
:::</p>
<p>But by 1945 London had to accept that Washington had eclipsed it, by a
wide margin, as the center of global power. Britain needed US financial
assistance and, if it could get it, US protection against what it saw as
the rise of Soviet power in Europe and Asia. Already in 1945, the Truman
Administration---as its own relations with Moscow soured---did not need
to impose its view in the matter on western European and British
leaders. They were as concerned by Stalin's policy as were any group in
Washington. British foreign secretary Bevin in 1945 told everyone who
wanted to listen, including Soviet foreign minister Molotov, that "it
was the Soviet government which was making things
difficult."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en059en">^27^</a>{#chapter002.xhtml#en059}</p>
<p>Although the United States and the Soviet Union were wartime allies,
some form of postwar conflict was next to inevitable. Leaders of the two
countries had seen each other as adversaries ever since the Russian
Revolution of 1917, and in some cases even before that. Stalin's policy
of prioritizing control of eastern Europe over good relations with his
allies contributed significantly to the weakening of the Grand Alliance
as the war was coming to an end, as did his wartime atrocities, for
instance in Poland, and his megalomania. Soviet ideology stood in the
way, too, since it considered a future conflict with the capitalist
world as unavoidable and predicted that intense revolutionary upheavals
would occur in the postwar era. On the US side, there was little
patience with the Soviet Union not recognizing the preponderance of the
United States in international affairs. President Truman did not have
the political agility and personal charm of President Roosevelt, and his
key advisers, who long had been advocating a tougher line on the
Soviets, led him to make decisions that pointed toward the containment
rather than the integration of the Soviet Union. As we shall see, it was
containment that made postwar conflict into a Cold War. Truman did not
understand FDR's policy of attempting to tie Moscow to international
arrangements and treaties. As the strongest power, the United States
should have done more to keep open channels of communication, of trade,
and of cultural and scientific exchange. Stalin would probably have
chosen isolation anyway. But the intensity of the conflict, including
the paranoia that it later produced on both sides, might have been
significantly reduced if more attempts had been made by the stronger
power to entice Moscow toward forms of cooperation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter002.xhtml#page-69}It has to be realized, though, that such
judgments can only be made with hindsight. It is not surprising that in
spite of the absolute predominance of the United States, many people
feared Soviet power, especially in Europe. The Red Army had vast forces
on that continent in 1945. In terms of numbers and proven capability
they outgunned everyone else. Soviet behavior in eastern Europe spread
foreboding. Some say that Stalin was indeed terrible to his own people,
but rather limited and traditional in his foreign policy aims. That may
be so, at least on some issues. But by 1945 Stalin had taken his
behavior into the heart of Europe and into China and Iran, too. Soviet
actions in these parts precipitated changes in US policies, and they
frightened others who glimpsed them from afar. By themselves, these
actions may not have precipitated a Cold War. But they certainly made
postwar containment against the Soviet Union much more likely.

<p>For anyone who had known Europe in 1914, or even in 1939, the
devastation wrought by five years of total war would have been
overwhelming. Hitler's vainglorious attempt at conquering the continent
had wrought destruction on a scale unprecedented in Europe's long
history of war and peace. From the Greek islands to the high north of
Scandinavia, cities had been firebombed, fields and orchards burned, and
people killed and buried in mass graves. Forty million had died. At
least as many were refugees or emerging from German concentration camps.
The Nazi genocide of six million Jews was the single greatest crime of
the war, in a horrible category all its own. The Holocaust also led to
widespread dislocation and chaos in regions where significant Jewish
populations had been removed. Starvation was widespread: in the Soviet
Union, Hungary, Poland, and parts of Germany, more than half the
population were slowly dying from hunger as the war ended.</p>
<p>Even if most of Europe was hungry, tired, and terrorized in 1945, the
situation was worst in the east. Along an enormous belt of land between
the Norwegian Arctic and the southern Balkans, the war between Germany
and the Soviet Union had left cities completely devastated and people
dead or dying. More than 1,700 towns were almost totally destroyed in
the USSR. Cities like Budapest, Minsk, or Kiev were more than 80 percent
uninhabitable. In his letters home, a young American relief worker tried
to give words to the destruction he witnessed in Warsaw: "Wherever you
walk here it is hunks of buildings standing up without roofs or much
sides, and people living in them. Except the Ghetto, where it is just a
great plain of bricks, with twisted beds and bath tubs and sofas,
pictures in frames, trunks, millions of things sticking out among the
bricks. I can't understand how it could have been done.... It's
something that's so vicious I can't believe
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en060en">^1^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en060} The world
most Europeans had lived in prior to 1914 had ceased to exist. In its
place had come death and destruction, and a lack of faith in old ideas.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-72}The Cold War between capitalism and
Communism, and between the United States and the Soviet Union, fit the
European disaster to a T. Not only had the military outcome of the war
left the Americans and the Soviets in command of the continent, but
Europeans, hungry for a miracle, or just plain hungry, looked to
Washington or Moscow for answers. For now, in a moment unique in
Europe's modern history, most of the continent was reduced to a supine
waiting on events outside its control. Europeans wanted a lasting peace.
They wanted rapid reconstruction. They wanted a future that was fair,
efficient, and economically successful. In other words, they wanted to
get as far away from the disasters of the 1930s and '40s as possible,
and Communism or American capitalism were each offering a way out.</p>
<p>And a way out was needed immediately. Europe in 1945 had come to a
standstill. Although the physical infrastructure could be rebuilt, there
was a deeply felt sense that things were not moving forward, that the
situation after the war ended was going from bad to worse. The continent
was facing a humanitarian crisis on a scale that Europe had not seen
since the seventeenth century. Within the prewar German borders alone
there were around seventeen million displaced people: concentration camp
survivors, slave laborers, German refugees from the east, or people who
had fled because their homes had been destroyed. They were all hungry
and all trying to get to somewhere they could not go. All forms of order
had broken down, and it was every man, woman, and child for themselves.
A Polish girl trying to get home was struck by the scale of it: "Germany
in 1945 was one huge ants' nest. Everyone was moving. This was how the
eastern territories of Germany looked like. There were Germans escaping
from the Russians. There were all these prisoners of war. There were
some of us [Poles]---not that many, but still.... It was really
incredible, teeming with people and
movement."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en061en">^2^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en061}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-73}Even in rich countries that had not
experienced hunger for at least three centuries the situation seemed
hopeless. In the Netherlands the population in the main cities got fewer
than eight hundred calories of food per person per day; the prewar
average had been close to three thousand. The Dutch hunger winter of
1944--45 killed at least twenty-two thousand people and its effects were
felt long
afterward.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en062en">^3^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en062}
Getting starving people to contribute to production was next to
impossible, and relief---in the Netherlands as elsewhere---could only
come from the outside. But in spite of massive attempts by the new UN
Relief and Recovery Administration (UNRRA), large parts of Europe still
did not have enough to eat by 1947.</p>
<p>The disasters that had befallen Europe put the prestige of the new
masters of the continent---the Americans and the Soviets, or the
Superpowers as Europeans had started calling them---into sharp relief.
Their military power was unquestioned, but unlike Britain---which also
had considerable military power in Europe in 1945, but seemed old and
exhausted---they could also provide new models of development for the
future. Much of the hope for change rode on such inspiration from the
outside. Even though the Americans could contribute much more in terms
of material supplies, Soviet prestige and Stalin's personal standing
were built on the Red Army's central role in defeating Nazi Germany.
Whoever could beat the German war machine and conquer Berlin must be a
very advanced country, many Europeans believed.</p>
<p>World War II brought total collapse to National Socialism and Fascism.
Right-wing Fascist-style authoritarian governments in the Spain of
Generalissimo Francisco Franco and the Portugal of António de Oliveira
Salazar survived only because they had been neutral during the war. For
collectivism and anticapitalism, Communism was the only game in town.
Not only had the Soviets played a key role in defeating Germany, but
Communist parties elsewhere had often been at the forefront of the
resistance against occupation and Nazi rule. In war, four years is a
very long time. Many people had forgiven or forgotten Stalin's pact with
Hitler, and the erstwhile Communist slogans against "the imperialist
robber war" had been drowned out by the post-1941 heroism of the Red
Army and local Communist partisans.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-74}In western Europe it was the hope for
change that fueled allegiance to the Communist cause. Almost no European
wanted to go back to systems that had created two world wars and a
profound economic crisis. The hope was for better, and the
Communists---with their blend of anti-Fascism, social justice, and
reflected glory from the Soviet war effort---carried high the banners of
hope. They were by far the biggest party organization in France (with
900,000 members) and in Italy (1.8 million). In the first postwar
western European elections, the Communists made inroads everywhere. In
Norway they got 12 percent of the vote, in Belgium 13 percent, in Italy
19 percent, in Finland 23.5 percent, and in France almost 29 percent.
Their leaders insisted on representation in government, which they got
in most of the national-unity cabinets formed after the war was over.
They wanted to have a decisive influence on politics in the future,
paving the way for a social revolution coming out of the demands of the
working class. But the Communist leaders did not believe in immediate
revolutionary upheavals in postwar western Europe. Reflecting the advice
they were getting from Moscow, they did not want to mount an outright
challenge to the existing governments when US and British troops were
still in control and could crush such rebellion out of hand.</p>
<p>But even the most powerful Communist leaders in western Europe---Maurice
Thorez in France, Palmiro Togliatti in Italy---could not hold back waves
of social upheaval that deprivation and degradation spread across the
continent. In Italy, workers took control of factories and peasants
occupied land. Both there and in France there was political violence
against established elites, against people who had collaborated with the
Nazis or the Fascists and against those who had not, but happened to own
a factory or had a noble title. Some were dragged out of their houses
and beaten to death. The elites were seen as responsible for everything
that had gone wrong in their countries.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-75}Communist government ministers had their
hands full campaigning for social stability and a return to work.
France's revival, Thorez said in a speech in October 1945, "depends on
our own efforts, the union of all republicans strengthened by the union
of the working
class."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en063en">^4^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en063}
Rebuilding came first, the Communist leader argued, and through
rebuilding would come political hegemony for the Left. But some local
Communists saw things differently. The government "and the rest, to hell
with them. I only have one boss, and that's Stalin," yelled a Communist
partisan in southern France as he and his men arrested and beat up local
noblemen.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en064en">^5^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en064}</p>
<p>But Stalin, as well as Thorez and Togliatti, at first believed that
revolutionary action in western Europe could destroy the Communist
parties as well as sound the death knell for the faltering Soviet
alliance with the United States and Britain. Stalin expected conflict
with the capitalist states and, eventually, Communist revolutions in
Europe. But after the end of the war the Soviet Union itself was in
ruins. Stalin could not risk a confrontation with his allies while the
Soviet Union was weak. Better then, Stalin thought, to express hope of
future cooperation while the American and British imperialists fought
over the spoils of war on their side. The biggest threat to the Soviet
Union, Stalin felt, was if the imperialist countries made a common front
against it. The initial postwar Soviet policy on western Europe was
designed to avoid such a coming together of its enemies.</p>
<p>In Greece, an ongoing civil war served as a warning to the Soviets and
European Communists of what could happen if they acted too soon. When
the Axis Powers occupied Greece in 1941, the country's Left formed a
National Liberation Front. The front gradually came under the control of
the Greek Communist Party, and its armed wing, the Greek People's
Liberation Army (ELAS), fought both the Germans and other Greek parties.
As the Germans withdrew in late 1944, the British arranged for a
coalition government and gradual integration of ELAS into the Greek
army. But when the Communist units refused to fully disband, the
coalition broke down. After the police opened fire on a Left-wing rally
in Athens in December 1944, killing twenty-eight civilians, ELAS fought
back. The British responded by aerial bombardments of Communist
strongholds in Athens. Outgunned in the capital and advised by the
Soviets to seek a compromise, the Greek Communist leaders agreed to
dissolve ELAS in the spring of 1945. Fighting continued in some areas,
mostly provoked by Right-wing attempts at driving peasants off the land
they had occupied during the war or punishing ELAS soldiers who had
fought against them. Six thousand Greek National Liberation Front
activists fled across the northern border to Communist-held Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-76}The Greek disaster led Stalin to demand
that other Communists, from China to Italy, not act prematurely. While
the Soviets believed that World War II would create revolutions, just as
Lenin had taught about the first world war, they expected them mainly in
those parts of Europe where the Red Army could help protect them,
meaning in the east. Stalin's view was that other Communist parties had
neither the experience nor the theoretical understanding to take and
keep power on their own. Only when they were guided by the Soviet Union
and protected by the Red Army would they stand a chance of permanently
defeating their enemies. The Soviet leader remembered well the "Soviet
republics" that had sprung up all over Europe, from Finland to Hungary
and Bavaria, after 1918. They had, the Soviet leader was fond of
explaining, quickly been snuffed out by a better-armed and
better-organized Right-wing, supported by the imperialist countries.
What made the 1940s different, Stalin believed, was the existence of the
Soviet Union as a political and military great power.</p>
<p>The Soviet strategic position in Europe in 1945 was truly remarkable, if
one compares it with Russia in 1918 or at any point since the end of the
Napoleonic wars. In little more than a year, since the spring of 1944,
the Red Army had broken all resistance on the way from deep inside the
Russian plains to a line that ran roughly from Lübeck and the Danish
island of Bornholm through the middle of Germany and Austria to the
Adriatic. The Soviet Union was now in central Europe. The breakdown of
Hitler's Third Reich had happened so suddenly that there was little
resistance to Soviet control in areas behind Red Army lines. In some
countries, such as Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, the Soviets
were generally welcomed as liberators. In others, including Hungary,
Poland, and the Baltic states, they were seen as conquerors. It all
depended on the locals' historic experience with Russia and the Soviet
Union. It also, of course, depended on the degree to which local
authorities and populations had collaborated with the Germans. But with
Hitler's Reich gone, the Soviets had total military preponderance in
eastern Europe. Even those who had reason to hate and distrust them
thought twice about challenging them in 1945.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-77}Stalin had yet to make up his mind, though,
about what to do with the vast regions of Europe now under his control.
Although his political judgment told him that none of the countries were
ripe for revolution in the Soviet sense, he hoped that the presence of
the Red Army and Soviet civilian advisers would strengthen the Left and
enable the Communists to gain significant influence. The Soviet example
might steer these countries toward socialism, the Kremlin leaders
thought. But in the meantime eastern Europe was important as a buffer
zone against any possible American and British imperialist attack on the
USSR. Stalin was convinced that Soviet influence had to remain there,
although he wanted to keep it in place in ways that did not cause a
break with the Americans and the British. The Soviet Union had to
rebuild. And until that rebuilding was in place, Stalin hoped to avoid
aggression from his World War II allies.</p>
<p>Soviet planning for postwar eastern Europe left much to be desired. The
Kremlin had been so preoccupied with fighting the war that there was
little time for thinking through postwar scenarios. Much like the United
States and Britain---but not nearly at the same level of detail---the
Soviets had produced some contingency plans for how to avoid mass
starvation and mass flight in eastern Europe as their forces advanced.
But even more so than in the west, the course of war defeated the best
laid plans. By mid-1945 the Red Army was in control of far more
territory in Europe than almost anyone in Moscow had expected. Red Army
commanders sought out local authorities who could establish a modicum of
order and help with the supply situation, including for their own
troops. In some regions, where warfare had been less intense or where
the local population welcomed the Soviets as Slavic liberators from
German tyranny, these tactics worked reasonably well. But the Red Army's
atrocities in war zones, or in non-Slavic countries that had opposed the
USSR (Hungary, Romania, and of course Germany) made it difficult even
for those who wanted to collaborate with the new masters to work with
them there.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-78}The killings, rapes, and robberies that
soldiers in the Red Army carried out against the civilian population did
much to impede Soviet ability to govern in eastern Europe. In Germany,
Soviet soldiers raped hundreds of thousands of women, possibly as many
as two million in total. These horrendous experiences were compounded by
destruction, theft, and wanton killings of unarmed civilians. By
mid-1945 there were very few families in the Soviet occupation zone of
Germany who had not experienced Red Army brutality, as had many people
in most zones that the Soviets moved into. A young German girl from East
Prussia was among a group of refugees who were attacked:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
Terrible hours followed, particularly for the women. From time to time,
soldiers came in, also officers, and fetched girls and young women. No
shrieking, no begging, nothing helped. With revolvers in their hands,
they gripped the women round their wrists and dragged them away. A
father who wanted to protect his daughter was brought into the yard and
shot. The girl was all the more the prey of these wild creatures.
Towards morning, she came back, terror in her child-like eyes. She had
become years older during the
night.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en065en">^6^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en065}
:::</p>
<p>Soviet leaders tried to excuse their soldiers' behavior by pointing to
the systematic cruelty of the Germans and their allies inside the USSR
during the war. Some Soviet propagandists and officers egged the
soldiers on in their savagery. For them it was a question of revenge.
But even for Stalin, who easily turned against his subordinates when
they engaged in behavior he considered counterproductive to his aims,
Soviet war crimes were a nonissue. He told a group of Yugoslav
Communists who complained about Red Army conduct, "One has to understand
the soul of the soldier who traveled three thousand kilometers of battle
from Stalingrad to Budapest. The soldier thinks that he is a hero,
everything is permitted, he is allowed to do anything, he is alive today
and might be killed tomorrow, [and] he will be forgiven. The soldiers
are tired, they are worn out in the prolonged and difficult war. It is
wrong to take the point of view of a 'decent
intellectual.'"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en066en">^7^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en066}
The Americans, British, and French also committed war crimes at the end
of the war in Europe. But they paled in comparison with Soviet actions,
which affected millions of families and left a legacy of hatred for
future generations.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-79}Eastern European Communists therefore
started their postwar agitation under difficult circumstances. Communism
had never been strong in the region, except perhaps in Czechoslovakia,
where the prewar party had gathered some 10 percent of the votes in free
elections.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en067en">^8^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en067}
Elsewhere the support for the Communist parties had been minuscule, and
the dictatorships in eastern Europe had been Right-wing, nationalist,
anti-Communist, and authoritarian. Even though they discounted the
effects of their own army's behavior, Soviet leaders saw the weakness of
eastern European Communism rather clearly. They believed that the social
and economic conditions for advanced socialism were not in place, at
least not yet. In some countries it would be hard to achieve even with
Soviet support and guidance. The first Soviet reports to come back from
eastern Europe in 1945 reported quite negatively on local political
conditions, especially---as could be expected---in Poland and Hungary.
Stalin himself dismissed the potential for home-grown revolution with a
down-home metaphor: "Communism would fit Poland as a saddle on a cow,"
he told Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's envoy, in
1944.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en068en">^9^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en068}</p>
<p>What, then, was the form of government in eastern Europe that the
Soviets were looking for? Having no experience with pluralism at home
and regarding "bourgeois democracy" as a sham, they naturally sought
authoritarian regimes that excluded the Soviets' wartime and prewar
enemies, that obeyed Stalin's instructions, and included the local
Communist parties. Given that there had been little love for Stalin in
the region in the past and that the Communists were weak, this meant a
very narrow base to rule from. Already by the fall of 1945 the Soviets
found that they did not have the instruments in place to secure future
influence in eastern Europe after the withdrawal of the Red Army.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-80}Bulgaria is an example of what this meant
in practice. After the collapse of the old pro-German regime, the
hastily assembled Fatherland Front coalition government increasingly
came under the control of the Bulgarian Communists. Though few in
numbers, they used their special relations with the Red Army to take
command of the ministry of the interior and the police. Thousands of the
Communists' Right-wing political opponents were tried by People's Courts
set up by the new government or organized by Communist activists
locally. Many were sent to prison camps or executed. But though the
Communist Party grew in influence and in support, most Bulgarians still
favored the Peasants' Party, a Left-wing agrarian reform group that had
joined in the Fatherland Front. In a country where more than 80 percent
of the population were peasants it could hardly have been otherwise.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Communists therefore faced a dilemma. The Soviets told
them that the right form of government for Bulgaria, at its stage of
development, was a "democratic" coalition government, meaning a
government of the Left that could rule efficiently and was beholden to
Moscow. Georgi Dimitrov, former head of the Comintern who had moved home
to take control of the Bulgarian Communist Party, was told that it was
fine for the Communists to expand their influence but not to break away
from "unity" with the Peasants' Party and other "progressive" forces.
But at the same time peasant leaders were becoming increasingly critical
of the Communists and their plans, which included the rapid
industrialization of Bulgaria. In May 1945, the Communists engineered a
split within the Peasants' Party, with a small pro-Communist faction
breaking away. The majority, headed by the formidable Nikola Petkov,
resigned from the government and ran on a separate ticket in the October
1945 elections. After much voter intimidation and outright fraud, the
Communist-dominated Fatherland Front won. From then on Dimitrov was in
charge. He made the country a People's Republic, meaning a republic
under Communist control; forced the Social Democrats to merge with the
Communists; and detained the main leaders of the non-Communist
opposition. Meanwhile, Petkov was arrested, sentenced to death, and
hanged in 1947.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-81}The concept "People's Republic" was a
Soviet invention from 1924, created for use in Outer Mongolia, a
territory in eastern Asia under Red Army control that Moscow could not
integrate as a full Soviet republic without serious problems with the
Chinese who had ruled there for centuries. But the People's Republic
concept fit the situation in eastern Europe, too. Stalin did not want to
integrate the eastern European countries into the Soviet Union; doing so
would be an unnecessary provocation for the Americans and western
Europeans. It would also mean large numbers of sullen, resistant peoples
inside Soviet territory. People's Republics became halfway houses: they
could become fully Communist, but not entirely Soviet. Even by the
beginning of 1947 Stalin had not made up his mind about a model for the
composition of future eastern European governments. He preferred
coalition governments, headed by powerful Communist parties.
Marxist-Leninist political theory told him that the "revolutions" in
eastern Europe were "national-democratic" revolutions, not socialist
ones. Full Communist rule would happen when circumstances permitted,
that is, when the Communist parties had won full hegemony over the
working class.</p>
<p>Romania posed a particular challenge for Soviet policies. It, too, had
been a German ally, imitating the Nazis by murdering hundreds of
thousands of Jews and Roma. It switched sides only in August 1944, when
the war was going very badly for Hitler. The Communist Party there was
weak and faction-ridden and did not have a key leader such as Dimitrov
in Bulgaria. Worse, in Stalin's view the Romanian party was dominated by
"non-Romanians"---basically, Jews and Hungarians---who would not be
recognized as "national" leaders. By the end of the war the Red Army had
full military control, with a million Soviet soldiers stationed in
Romania. But where to turn for effective local leadership? The Soviets
decided to install a coalition government, as in Bulgaria, with the
Communist Party in control of the ministry of justice and therefore the
police. The young Romanian king, Michael, protested. Michael was
regarded as a national hero after dismissing the pro-German leadership,
but the Soviet emissary Andrei Vyshinskii gave him no choice. "You have
two hours and five minutes to make it known to the public that [the
government] has been dismissed," the Soviet deputy foreign minister
barked at the king. "By eight o'clock you must inform the public of
[the]
successor."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en069en">^10^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en069} In
November 1945 the Communist-led coalition won an election through
widespread intimidation and fraud. Two years later it forced the king to
abdicate. The government announced that a new People's Republic of
Romania was up and running.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-82}Bulgaria and Romania may have been tricky
for the Soviets to control, but they paled in comparison with the real
test, which was Poland. The Soviets were generally hated in this largest
of the European countries that had now come under their military
control. Imperial Russia had lorded it over parts of Polish territory
since the eighteenth century. The Soviet Communists had fought and lost
a war against Poland in the early 1920s. Stalin and Hitler had invaded
the country and divided it between them in 1939. Then, after having
congratulated the Germans on their conquest of Warsaw, Foreign Minister
Molotov explained to his partners that the USSR "intended to take the
occasion of the further advance of German troops to declare that Poland
was falling apart and that it was necessary for the Soviet Union, in
consequence, to come to the aid of the Ukrainians and the White
Russians."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en070en">^11^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en070} In
the course of this "aid," the Soviets had introduced a reign of terror
in the part of Poland they had occupied up to 1941, when their German
partners betrayed them. Then, in 1944, the Red Army had stood silently
by as the Germans slaughtered the desperate Polish resistance in Warsaw.
Quite a record on which to create a friendly neighborhood ally.</p>
<p>And still Stalin believed his regime could build a new Poland, with the
Polish Communist Party (PPR), however weak, playing a significant role.
One element involved a curious mixed army. After Hitler invaded the
Soviet Union, the Red Army began recruiting Polish soldiers to fight the
Nazis. Most of these men came straight from Soviet prison camps, where
they had been since 1939. Not surprisingly, Stalin soon realized that
keeping such an army on Soviet soil was a bad idea. He quietly let the
British send most of these Poles to fight in the Mediterranean under
command of the Polish government-in-exile. But some remained, forming
the Polish Army in the USSR, fighting under Red Army command. They were
a combination of Communists, Leftists, eastern Poles, and those who
simply wanted to fight the Germans closer to home than on faraway
battlegrounds in North Africa or Italy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-83}In January 1945, before the Yalta
Conference, the Soviets had established a provisional government of the
Republic of Poland, ignoring the government-in-exile, with which it
(understandably) had bad relations. At Yalta, the powers had agreed to a
merger of the two governments and free elections in Poland as soon as
possible. It was an attempt at a compromise that made nobody happy, but
it was based on military facts on the ground: the Red Army was in full
control of Poland. President Roosevelt's chief of staff, William Leahy,
pointed out to the president privately that Stalin's promise was "so
elastic that the Russians can stretch it all the way from Yalta to
Washington without ever technically breaking
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en071en">^12^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en071} The new
"coalition" government in Warsaw was a marvel of Communist
dissimulation: technically it had a non-Communist majority, including
some ministers who had returned from London, but in reality it was
controlled by Polish Communists under Soviet tutelage.</p>
<p>The big question for the Polish Communists after the war was how to
increase their public appeal. History counted against them. The brutal
behavior of Red Army soldiers did not help. Even the man the Soviets
handpicked as the head of the Polish Communist Party, Władysław Gomułka,
noted that "the mistakes that the Soviet organs have committed with
regard to the Poles (deportations) have influenced the public opinion...
; given these attitudes, there is a danger that we might be accused of
being Soviet agents and subjected to
isolation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en072en">^13^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en072} But
the Communists also had clear advantages. They had the Red Army and the
Polish Army in the USSR to support them in case of trouble. They had
international recognition for their government. Their own party may have
been in bad shape, but so were all other political parties. They had the
advantage that the main treaty with the Soviet Union was signed before
the coalition government came into office, and before the crucial
decision to incorporate former German territory into Poland and cede
Polish lands in the east to the Soviets had been made by the Great
Powers at Yalta. The Polish Communists and their allies could therefore
claim that they were making the best of a difficult situation: they
claimed to stand not just for a rapid modern transformation of a
war-torn country, but also for stability and independence.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-84}The Polish Communists had some takers for
their message, improbable as it may sound. As everywhere else in eastern
Europe, people were tired of fighting and starving. They might not like
the new government, but it represented authority and stability. At the
end of 1945, Stalin told the Polish Communists they were not taking
enough credit for their achievements. "It is ridiculous that you are
afraid of accusations that you are against independence.... You are the
ones who built independence. If there were no PPR, there would be no
independence. You created the army, built the state structures, the
financial system, the economy, the state.... Instead of telling them all
that, you are saying only that you support independence. The PPR turned
the USSR into an ally of Poland. The arguments are right there at your
feet and you don't know how to make use of
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en073en">^14^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en073} But not
only Stalin thought that the Polish Communists were in a much improved
situation. Many Poles who disliked the Soviets and the local Communists
accommodated themselves to the regime. The Polish-Lithuanian writer
Czesław Miłosz, then thirty-five, who later wrote one of the most
scathing---and accurate---analyses of the accommodation of intellectuals
in eastern Europe---agreed to serve in the new government's foreign
ministry. "I was delighted," Miłosz wrote, "to see the semi-feudal
structure of Poland finally smashed, the universities opened to young
workers and peasants, agrarian reform undertaken and the country finally
set on the road to
industrialization."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en074en">^15^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en074}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-85}Meanwhile the Communists' attempts at
securing their control of the Polish state and Polish society continued.
In mid-1946 they managed, by hook and by crook, to get a majority in a
referendum supporting land reform and nationalization of basic
industries. During that year the Communists gradually, with Soviet
assistance, outmaneuvered their Left-wing coalition partners and
marginalized them. A few brave politicians---such as Stanisław
Mikołajczyk, the leader of the centrist Polish People's
Party---attempted to hold them back, and the Polish Catholic Church
complained about the country being ruled by atheistic Communists. But no
one in Poland had a strategy to prevent Communist domination. Neither
did Britain nor the United States. Both the new British foreign
secretary Ernest Bevin and US secretary of state James F. Byrnes kept
reminding the Soviets of their obligations to arrange free elections in
Poland. But neither man believed that Stalin would have known how to
organize a free election even if he had wanted to. And Stalin did not
want the Poles to vote freely because he knew that in spite of the
Communist advances there was no chance they and their allies could win.
When Stalin finally agreed to elections in January 1947---ironically
first and foremost in a belated attempt at placating the other Great
Powers---the Soviets and the Polish Communists made sure that not a vote
was counted that should not be. With deception and coercion and the
exclusion of opposition candidates on trumped-up charges, the
Communist-led Democratic Bloc claimed to have won more than 80 percent
of the vote. Opposition leaders ended up in prison or in exile. But the
Soviets were still not secure. One of their officials in Poland, in
charge of culture, reported to Moscow that he was continuously working
to "suggest to the Poles the thought that only in friendship with the
USSR will they achieve peace and economic prosperity, that any other
path spells trouble for them;... to promote the economic and military
power of the USSR; [and] to dispel slanderous statements about the
backwardness of Soviet culture and technology." But he could report
little progress.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en075en">^16^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en075}</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia and Hungary were the most developed of the countries the
Red Army occupied after 1944. Before 1918, Hungary had been a key part
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which dominated central Europe. During
World War II, its authoritarian Right-wing government had allied itself
with Nazi Germany, with disastrous consequences as the war ended. The
Soviets shot their way through eastern Hungary to the capital, Budapest,
which was then subjected to a devastating siege. When the Hungarian
government tried to arrange a cease-fire, local Fascists rebelled and
fought on alongside the Germans until the German surrender in May 1945.
Even more than its neighbors, the Hungarians had got the short end of
the stick: not only had the country been devastated by war, but its
elites had not managed to change sides in time. As a result, Hungary was
occupied not only by the Red Army, but by the Romanians, with whom the
country had a number of overlapping territorial claims.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-86}Stalin's view of Hungary was colored by the
sad fate of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 and by
what he saw as the strength of the political Right. He instructed the
Hungarian Communist leaders who returned from Moscow in order to
reestablish their party in Budapest to be careful. Do "not be sparing
with words, [but] do not scare anyone," the Boss admonished. "Once you
gain strength you may move
on."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en076en">^17^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en076} The land
reform policies of the coalition government that took over running the
country after the German capitulation did prove popular, and the
Communists thought they could take much of the credit. They bragged
about their influence to Stalin. The Soviet leader, however distrustful
he was of the Hungarian party's predominantly Jewish leadership, allowed
elections to go ahead in Hungary in the fall of 1945, on the assumption
that the Communists would do well. It is also likely that Stalin
intended his generosity toward the Hungarians to reduce tension with his
allies while he made up his mind about the country's future.</p>
<p>The Hungarian election of 1945 became a disaster for the Communists. By
all ordinary measurements they did well by getting 16 percent of the
vote in a country where they had not existed a few months previously.
But with the Soviets expecting them to do much better and---worst of
all---the Right-wing Smallholders' Party getting more than 50 percent,
Stalin feared he might lose control of a country that was on the edge of
his new sphere of influence. He instructed his old comrade Marshal
Kliment Voroshilov, the Soviet representative in Hungary, to insist that
"the Communists receive the Interior Ministry; recommend that two posts
of deputy prime minister be created additionally and that these be
awarded to the Communists and the Social Democrats; pay attention mainly
to ensuring that those entering the new Hungarian government from the
Smallholders' Party and the Social Democrats should be people also
acceptable personally to the Soviet
government."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en077en">^18^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en077}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-87}By issuing this ultimatum, the Soviets
secured considerable Communist influence in the new government. In spite
of its majority of votes, the Smallholders' Party was still hostage to
Communist policies because of Soviet manipulation and because they
believed that confronting the Communists would risk Moscow's goodwill
concerning Hungary's territorial aspirations. Hungary's economic
situation was precarious, and with Moscow blocking Budapest from
applying for American loans, outside assistance could only come from the
USSR. By mid-1947 Hungary's Communists, led by the inveterate Stalinist
Mátyás Rákosi, felt that they had decimated their coalition partners
enough through arrests, deportations, and intimidation for another
election to take place. In August 1947 the Communist Party and its
Left-wing allies won 60 percent of the vote after much rigging. With
increased confrontation with his former allies looming, Stalin gave his
blessing to the new regime, even though he remained unsure of whether
the Hungarian Communists could manage the situation.</p>
<p>Between 1944 and 1947 Soviet policies in eastern Europe gave rise to
much conflict with the United States and Britain. But American and
British policies---in part in response to Moscow's behavior in the
east---also helped convince Stalin that only through Communist regimes
could Soviet control of eastern Europe be made secure. With Soviet
military control already in place, it is likely that a Sovietization of
eastern Europe would have happened at some point whatever the policies
of others had been. There were a number of very weak states along the
Soviet European borders, mostly remnants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
that had collapsed back in 1918. After the German breakdown in 1945,
Soviet control seemed probable. But there is no doubt that the advent of
a Cold War between the Soviets and the United States made complete
Communist takeovers everywhere in eastern Europe more critical and
urgent for Moscow. By 1947, Stalin may still have believed that his
neighbors were not ready for socialism. But he had concluded that only
Communist rule could deliver the kind of security the Soviet Union
wanted.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-88}After the Potsdam Conference, Britain and
the United States repeatedly protested the Soviets' behavior in the
countries they occupied at the end of the war. The regular meetings of
the allied foreign ministers became increasingly confrontational, even
though the Truman administration realized that it did not have the power
to change Soviet policies in areas that the Red Army controlled. The
president wanted postwar demobilization to go ahead, bringing US troops
back from Europe. But the United States and Britain, working
increasingly closely with each other, clashed verbally with the Soviets
over reparations from Germany and Italy, over the content of the peace
agreements with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and over the question of
the Italian city of Trieste, which had been occupied by the Yugoslav
Communists at the end of the war. The short-tempered British foreign
secretary, Ernest Bevin, was furious with his Soviet colleague, Molotov,
at a Paris meeting in the summer of 1946. It appeared to him, Bevin
said, that "the procedure of this conference was not to decide
anything." The Russian coolly retorted that "Bevin should not
underestimate his services in helping to produce that
result."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en078en">^19^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en078} In
Washington, President Truman wrote that he was "tired of babying the
Soviets."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en079en">^20^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en079}</p>
<p>By the spring of 1947 many Europeans and most US policy-makers had
become fixated on a seemingly relentless pattern of Soviet expansionism
in eastern Europe. Never mind that this was not how matters may have
seemed from Moscow or from within the eastern European countries
themselves. In all of these places developments seemed more contingent,
more diverse, and generally more chaotic. Still, in the west, many who
had lived through the 1930s noted similarities with Nazi expansionism.
And there was the scale of it: Soviet control seemed to be imposing
itself over half of Europe. In spite of Stalin only acting in countries
that had come under Red Army control, there was no clear limit to
"eastern Europe" in the minds of many Europeans or Americans. Were
Finland and Norway fundamentally different from Czechoslovakia? Were
Greece and Turkey different from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia? From the far
vantage point of today it may indeed seem so, and Soviet aims therefore
seem more limited. But such demarcation lines were hard to see for those
who had grown up with a more diverse Europe, where division lines
between east and west did not readily exist.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-89}From the start of his tenure, President
Truman believed that the Soviets were expansionist in nature, but also
that they would not take the risk of a complete break with the United
States and Britain. But over the next two years, Truman started to doubt
his original judgment. He was furious over Soviet behavior in eastern
Europe, where he felt that Stalin had reneged on promises given to FDR
about establishing democracies there. He also believed the Soviets were
increasingly engaging in confrontational conduct not only in Europe but
in Asia, too. Many leaders whom Truman respected were fueling his
suspicions. In a March 1946 speech at Westminster College in Fulton,
Missouri, where he was introduced by Truman himself, former British
prime minister Winston Churchill spoke again about immediate danger. Its
motifs, especially the idea of an "iron curtain descending across the
continent," he had rehearsed in his letter to Truman a year before. But
this was public. The old lion roared:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain
has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the
capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw,
Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all
these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must
call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not
only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases,
increasing measure of control from Moscow.... In front of the iron
curtain which lies across Europe are other causes for anxiety.... The
future of Italy hangs in the balance.... In a great number of countries,
far from the Russian frontiers and throughout the world, Communist fifth
columns are established and work in complete unity and absolute
obedience to the directions they receive from the Communist centre. Last
time I saw it all coming and cried aloud to my own fellow-countrymen and
to the world, but no one paid any attention.... We surely must not let
that happen
again.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en080en">^21^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en080}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-90}Churchill's warning was echoed by a young
and talented US diplomat, George F. Kennan, who had served in Moscow
during the war. Kennan's Long Telegram, as it became known, sent from
Moscow on 22 February 1946 to the State Department, became an
influential, widely distributed document in the Administration. In it
Kennan described Moscow's policy as inherently aggressive and
expansionist because of its Marxist-Leninist ideology. While the Russian
people preferred peace, they were held hostage by a party that exploited
traditional Russian insecurities against the more advanced parts of
Europe. The past had told Russians that only through destroying an enemy
could security be achieved. And the current Soviet aim was to weaken
foreign powers, through splits and subversion, until Moscow's
predominance was complete:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that
with the US there can be no permanent modus vivendi, that it is
desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be
disrupted, our traditional way of life be destroyed, the international
authority of our state be broken, if Soviet power is to be secure. This
political force has complete power of disposition over energies of one
of world's greatest peoples and resources of world's richest national
territory, and is borne along by deep and powerful currents of Russian
nationalism. In addition, it has an elaborate and far flung apparatus
for exertion of its influence in other countries, an apparatus of
amazing flexibility and versatility, managed by people whose experience
and skill in underground methods are presumably without parallel in
history.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en081en">^22^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en081}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-91}But Kennan, as did his superiors in
Washington, believed that war could be avoided. Stalin was not taking
unnecessary risks. And the USSR was still much weaker than the United
States and had significant internal problems. Containing the Soviet
threat, however, meant that the Truman Administration had to become more
forward in its foreign policy:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We must formulate and put forward for other nations a much more positive
and constructive picture of the sort of world we would like to see than
we have put forward in the past. It is not enough to urge people to
develop political processes similar to our own. Many foreign peoples, in
Europe at least, are tired and frightened by experiences of the past,
and are less interested in abstract freedom than in security. They are
seeking guidance rather than responsibilities. We should be better able
than Russians to give them this. And unless we do, Russians certainly
will.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en082en">^23^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en082}
:::</p>
<p>George Kennan's message was more a summing up of where many US
policy-makers were already heading than an innovative policy
prescription. It was also in parts contradictory: the Soviets were
inherently aggressive but also able to compromise. But for officials
hungry for ways of explaining an increasingly complicated world, it
resonated. In spite of some compromises being reached at the Paris
foreign ministers' meeting, other worries, such as a new flare-up of the
Greek civil war and new Soviet demands on Turkey, darkened the picture
in late 1946. Truman was increasingly concerned that the Soviets were
planning to take control of the Black Sea Straits and help the
Communists win in Greece. Such a breakthrough would put the Soviet Union
in control of the eastern Mediterranean. It would also be a serious blow
to Britain, the traditionally predominant power there, at a time when
the British domestic economic situation seemed to be going from bad to
worse. In a calculated attempt at getting the United States to back up
London's interests in deeds as well as words, the British Labour
government formally appealed to Truman for assistance.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-92}The US president now faced some tough
choices. Though the economy had avoided the postwar slump that many had
predicted, Truman's Democrats had fared badly in the November 1946
midterm elections, with the Republicans taking control of both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1932. In the campaign, his opponents
had castigated Truman for being too preoccupied with helping foreign
countries and for being too soft on Stalin and the Communists. With
public opinion moving in different directions at the same time, Truman
felt that the situation called for bold leadership. Although the
president knew little about foreign affairs and understood even less,
his temperament as well as his political instincts provided a way
forward. Truman had been looking for means by which to confront the
Soviets. In Greece and Turkey he found one. In March 1947 he addressed a
joint session of Congress, in which he asked for up to \$400 million
(\$4.3 billion today) in immediate US economic and military assistance
to the two countries. "The very existence of the Greek state is today
threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men,
led by Communists, who defy the government's authority," Truman said.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We shall not realize our objectives... unless we are willing to help
free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national
integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them
totalitarian regimes. This is no more than a frank recognition that
totalitarian regimes imposed upon free peoples, by direct or indirect
aggression, undermine the foundations of international peace and hence
the security of the United States.... I believe that it must be the
policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting
attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside
pressures.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en083en">^24^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en083}
:::</p>
<p>Truman's new secretary of state, General George C. Marshall, whom the
president called the most admired man in America, put the situation even
more starkly in a closed meeting with Congressional leaders. "We have
arrived at a situation which has not been paralleled since ancient
history," Marshall and his deputy, the suave, self-confident Dean
Acheson, told them, according to a summary of the meeting. "A situation
in which the world is dominated by two great powers. Not since Athens
and Sparta, not since Rome and Carthage have we had such polarization of
power. It is thus not a question of pulling British chestnuts out of the
fire. It is a question of the security of the United States. It is a
question of whether two-thirds of the area of the world... is to be
controlled by
Communists."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en084en">^25^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en084} The
Administration was following the Republican internationalist senator
Arthur Vandenberg's advice to Truman: it was only through "scaring the
hell out of the American people" that the White House could get what it
wanted. And Truman's address---known later as the Truman
Doctrine---frightened Congress enough to grant the president's wishes.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-93}While the Soviets were busy subduing
eastern Europe and the Americans debated their future role abroad,
western Europe's economic situation continued to deteriorate. Very
different from expectations in Washington or London, the supply
situation in most of France and the Low Countries, not to mention in
Germany and Italy, had not improved as the military and political
situation stabilized. Instead, the winter of 1946--47 was among the
worst Europeans had ever experienced, with dwindling food stocks,
unstable currencies, and diminishing industrial outputs. In a note to
his boss Secretary Marshall, the undersecretary of state for economic
affairs, William Clayton, laid out the stark realities in May 1947:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
It is now obvious that we grossly underestimated the destruction to the
European economy by the war. We understood the physical destruction, but
we failed to take fully into account the effects of economic dislocation
on production... Europe is steadily deteriorating.... Millions of people
in the cities are slowly starving.... Without further prompt and
substantial aid from the United States, economic, social and political
disintegration will overwhelm Europe. Aside from the awful implications
which this would have for the future peace and security of the world,
the immediate effects on our domestic economy would be disastrous:
markets for our surplus production gone, unemployment,
depression.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en085en">^26^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en085}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-94}To remedy the situation, and to rescue both
the western European and the US economies, Truman decided on a gamble.
He would ask Congress for an unprecedented grant for European
reconstruction. Presented in June 1947 by Secretary of State George
Marshall, and henceforth known as the Marshall Plan, the scheme would
provide over \$12 billion (\$132 billion in 2016 dollars) over four
years to European countries that signed up to receive it. The conditions
seemed unrestrictive: the recipient countries would need to cooperate
with each other, open up their economies for outside reporting, and
accept American envoys who would help decide where the aid should be
allocated. Washington knew that American control (and benefit) would
mostly be secured through the Europeans buying US goods for what they
received. The main western European countries jumped at the opportunity.
The same month France and Britain invited other countries to assemble in
Paris to discuss a European response to the American offer. The USSR and
the eastern European countries were invited, too. Given the tense
situation that existed, Truman expected the Soviets to turn the offer
down. But he was willing to take the risk, since not to do so would have
made the Marshall Plan a too obvious instrument for waging a Cold War
against Moscow.</p>
<p>Stalin hesitated. On the one hand the Soviets and east Europeans needed
funds for reconstruction, even more than what the west Europeans did. On
the other hand he sensed a trap. Stalin first sent Foreign Minister
Molotov to Paris with a large delegation, only to order them to walk out
after a few days. Accepting the plan, Molotov declared in Paris, would
lead to American hegemony in Europe and a divided continent. When the
Czechoslovaks still seemed eager to explore the US offer, Stalin
lambasted their pro-Soviet prime minister Klement Gottwald, leaving him
shaking: "He reproached me bitterly for having accepted the invitation
to participate in the Paris Conference. He does not understand how we
could have done it. He says we acted as if we were ready to turn our
back on the Soviet
Union."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en086en">^27^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en086} Moscow
made its views clear to all eastern European governments: American
assistance would be regarded as an anti-Soviet act.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-95}One of Stalin's main anxieties around the
Marshall Plan was the future of Germany. After the war ended, the
country and its capital, Berlin, had been divided into four zones of
occupation, with the Soviets taking control of the eastern part. Stalin
believed that a neutral, or in the best case, socialist, Germany was the
key to Soviet influence in Europe. In spite of what he often told his
foreign interlocutors, he was not primarily concerned with German
revanchism; he knew that Germany was removed as a serious military force
in Europe for a long time to come. But he was concerned that the western
powers---above all the United States---might turn the German territory
they controlled into an arsenal for a future confrontation with the
Soviet Union. The others ruled the richer part of Germany. And if they
integrated it into the Marshall Plan, they would control it permanently.
Stalin wanted to avoid such an eventuality, even if it meant depriving
his own people and all those of eastern Europe of much-needed aid.</p>
<p>The controversy over the Marshall Plan reminded Stalin about the need to
bring Czechoslovakia fully to heel. Even if he had not done so, the
Czechoslovak Communists would have been there to remind him. By far the
most powerful Communist party in east-central Europe, it had received 38
percent of the vote in a free election in 1946, making it the biggest
party in the Czech lands, including in the capital, Prague. Much of the
extraordinary support for Communism in Czechoslovakia was an effect of
the failure of Britain and France to support the country against the
German occupation of 1938--45. The feeling, which went much beyond the
Communists, was that the western powers could not be trusted and that
the Soviet Union was a necessary and often admired partner. Ever since
1945, the party leaders had pushed for a Czechoslovak revolution---the
seizing of total power by the party and its affiliates---but until the
autumn of 1947 Stalin refused to give his go-ahead, preferring a
coalition government. With a more hard-line policy coming from the
Soviets, the Czechoslovak Communists concluded that they had the all
clear, and in February 1948 they struck, using the threat of civil war
and Soviet intervention to force the aging president, Edvard Beneš, to
appoint a government fully controlled by the Communist Party. The police
and security services, already in Communist hands, began rounding up
"enemies of the people."</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-96}The Czechoslovak coup was a shock to many
in western Europe, far beyond the anti-Communist Right. Czechoslovakia's
inclusion in a Soviet sphere had in no way been seen as a given by other
Europeans. There was also---especially in Britain and France---a sense
of the need to stand up for the Czechoslovak people, who had been so
appallingly betrayed in 1938. Most important was the feeling within the
non-Communist western European Left---socialists and
social-democrats---that Soviet expansionism and Communist militancy now
were a direct threat to them and not only to the old elites. In Norway,
for instance, where the ruling Labor Party was traditionally one of the
most Left-leaning Social Democratic parties in Europe, Prime Minister
Einar Gerhardsen spoke out against the Soviets and the local Communists:
"The events in Czechoslovakia have not only aroused sorrow and anger
among most Norwegians, but also fear and alarm. Norway's problem is, as
far as I can see, primarily a domestic problem. What could threaten the
freedom and democracy of the Norwegian people is the danger that the
Norwegian Communist Party represents at any given time. The most
important task in the struggle for Norway's independence, for democracy
and the rule of law, is to reduce the influence of the Communist Party
and the Communists as much as
possible."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en087en">^28^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en087}</p>
<p>The Norwegian Communists, few in number and already politically
isolated, had no chance to counter the might of a well-organized and
unsparing Social Democratic movement. It was a pattern that repeated
itself all over Scandinavia, in the Low Countries, and in Austria after
the Czechoslovak coup.</p>
<p>Part of the weakness of many western European Communist parties stemmed
from new instructions from Stalin. It had become clear to him that the
main postwar conflict would not be between the remaining capitalist
powers, but between the capitalist world, headed by the United States,
and the Soviet Union. Now, in this new state of things, an old weapon
would be retooled. In September 1947, the Communist International, the
Comintern, which had been dissolved during the war as a gesture of
goodwill---with the war on, it did not make much sense to seek to foment
revolution among your allies---was resurrected as the Cominform
(Communist Information Bureau). At its inaugural meeting at Szklarska
Poręba on the Polish-Czechoslovak border, Stalin's deputy for issues of
ideology, Andrei Zhdanov, made clear the Boss's current thinking with a
decisive clarity:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-97}The crusade against Communism proclaimed by
America's ruling circle with the backing of the capitalist monopolies,
leads as a logical consequence to the attacks on the fundamental rights
and interests of the American working people... to adventures abroad in
poisoning the minds of the politically backward and unenlightened
American masses with a virus of chauvinism and militarism, and in
stultifying the average American with the help of all the diverse means
of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist propaganda---the cinema, the radio,
the church and the press.... The strategic plans of the United States
envisage the creation in peacetime of numerous bases and vantage grounds
situated at great distances from the American continent against the USSR
and the countries of the new democracy. America has built, or is
building, air and naval bases in Alaska, Japan, Italy, South Korea,
China, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Austria and Western Germany....
Economic expansion is an important supplement to the realization of
America's strategical plan. American imperialism is endeavoring... to
take advantage of the post-war difficulties of the European countries,
in particular the shortage of raw materials, fuel and food in the Allied
countries that suffered most from the war, to dictate to them
extortionate terms for any assistance
rendered.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en088en">^29^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en088}
:::</p>
<p>Stalin suspected that the western European Communist parties were being
seduced by the Americans and the local elites. The leaders of the French
Communist Party "have fallen prey to the fear that France would collapse
without American credits," he told his inner circle at a drunken party
at his dacha in August 1947. At the Szklarska Poręba meetings the next
month, the verbal attacks continued. The Soviets entrusted the Yugoslavs
with launching a stinging attack on their comrades in western Europe:
"After the war, certain communists thought that a peaceful,
parliamentary period of appeasement of the class struggle was
ahead---there was a deviation towards opportunism and parliamentarism,
in the French party, the Italian party, as in other
parties."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en089en">^30^</a>{#chapter003.xhtml#en089}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter003.xhtml#page-98}By the beginning of 1948 a Cold War system
of states was being established in Europe. A lot was still unclear, but
the main characteristics were known. Communist parties would be in
political control of the countries occupied by the Soviet Union at the
end of World War II. The United States would remain involved in European
affairs. Britain's role was permanently reduced. Most of the western
European Left would side with their governments against the Communists
and the Soviets. Although neither the Soviets nor the Americans wanted
war in Europe, military tension was likely to grow. The American
government was increasingly thinking of European and world politics in
terms of containment of the Soviet Union and Communism. Soviet
leaders---essentially Stalin himself---were choosing security and
ideological rectitude over any potential for limited cooperation with
the United States and Britain. And while Europe was changing politically
in dramatic ways, the reconstruction of its economies and social
structure was taking longer than anyone had expected.

<p>During the 1940s and early 1950s, Europe and the rest of the world were
being reconstructed in ways that would have been hard to recognize from
the early part of the century. Some of this reconstruction was physical,
made necessary by the ravages of war. But there was also a political and
intellectual reconstruction going on, which put the Cold War between
Communism and capitalism, and between the Soviet Union and the United
States, at the center of world affairs. For people in most parts of the
world it was increasingly as if the great power conflict had something
to do with them, often at the personal level. Over and over again,
events that were in origin local and specific metamorphosed into
manifestations of a global struggle. The main reason for this was that
both the Soviets and the Americans---as Kennan had pointed out in his
Long Telegram---stood for models of human endeavor that had universalist
pretensions. The Nazis had tried to rule through extermination. The
colonial empires had ruled through exploitation and racial oppression.
But the undoubted cruelty that both emerging Superpowers were capable
of---nuclear extermination of cities or millions sent to labor
camps---was offset in people's minds by the promise each held of a
better life, especially for those in the many parts of the world who had
gone through hell in the first decades of the twentieth century. The
reconstruction that took place in the first years after the war ended
was psychological as well as physical, and it privileged a Cold War
competition for people's minds.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-100}At first, agendas changed rather subtly,
and then---as wartime attempts at cooperation faded from memory---the
changes happened more and more quickly. One good example is the United
Nations, the brainchild of President Roosevelt, the world organization
through which he wanted to make up for the US failure to help build
peace and prosperity after World War I. To begin with, the UN
concentrated on rescue and relief operations in Europe and Asia; through
the UN Relief and Recovery Administration much was achieved, mainly with
US funding. The UN agencies dealing with food and health, the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, began work
to study and ameliorate famine and epidemics with support by both
Superpowers, and without much overt Cold War interference. Even the new
world economic institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, launched relatively smoothly, although the United
States---as the biggest provider of funds---kept control of who could
receive funding. Stalin at first regarded the UN simply as a concession
to his wartime American partners and took little interest in its
proceedings, except through the UN Security Council, where the Soviet
Union used its veto to block resolutions it did not like.</p>
<p>It was the Americans who first discovered how the UN could serve their
Cold War purposes. The text of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was passed in 1948 by a coalition of American New Dealers,
western European liberals, and postcolonial elites, with the Soviets
unable to block it. They in the end abstained from the vote, along with
seven other states. Forty-eight voted in favor. The Chilean
representative summed up the conflict in distinct terms: "The views
expressed by the Polish representative and shared by the USSR delegation
resulted from a different conception of life and man. The draft
declaration rested on the assumption that the interests of the
individual came before those of the State and that the State should not
be allowed to deprive the individual of his dignity and his basic
rights. The opposing conception was that the rights of the individual
must give precedence to the interests of
society."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en090en">^1^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en090} The
declaration may not have had much practical significance in the first
decades of the Cold War, but its adaptation was a victory for the United
States over Soviet concepts of rights.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-101}While words could be made into weapons at
the UN, science could be made into weapons at the world's top
universities and laboratories. In 1945, some observers thought that the
invention of nuclear weapons would prevent armed conflict in the future.
The consequences of war would simply be too great. But the Truman
Administration did not heed calls for shared control of the frightful
new weapons through the UN. Instead, the US military gradually began
integral planning for the use of atomic bombs in warfare. "Plan Broiler"
from November 1947---one of the first complete war plans against the
Soviet Union drawn up by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff---envisaged
thirty-four atomic bombs dropped on twenty-four Soviet cities. The White
House and top military commanders were aware of the terrifying gulf that
separated nuclear weapons from conventional weapons, in spite of calls
from some officers and members of Congress to make atomic bombs more
readily available at the potential frontlines of a war with the Soviets.
Truman had read the medical reports coming in from tests made on
survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb was not just
another weapon, and the Administration was uncertain both about
production and control. Still, having a nuclear monopoly gave the
Americans confidence, and boosted their willingness to develop a global
strategy. By the end of 1949 more than two hundred bombs had been
produced, and twenty B-29 bombers had been modified to carry them.</p>
<p>For the Soviet Union the US nuclear monopoly was an immediate threat,
even though neither Stalin nor his American counterparts believed that
atomic weapons by themselves would win a war. Outwardly the Soviets used
the US refusal to share nuclear technology as part of its "peace
campaign," portraying the Truman Administration as warmongers, hell-bent
on nuclear destruction. Internally, Stalin had started a crash program
to develop a Soviet nuke. Using a combination of Soviet physics' prowess
and intelligence gathered from spies within the US program, the plans
made rapid progress. The first test in August 1949 was an example of
what Soviet science could achieve. Even though the Soviets were only
able to develop five or six atomic bombs over the first couple of years,
it started an arms race in which Moscow seemed to be catching up with
Washington. In November 1952 the Americans tested the first
thermonuclear weapon, the so-called hydrogen or H-bomb, a nuclear weapon
450 times more powerful than the bomb that had destroyed Hiroshima in
1945. The Soviets tested a similar weapon only nine months later.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-102}The US invention of nuclear weapons made
most Americans feel that their country had unique power and
responsibility in the world. After the Soviets got their nukes, it also
created a sense of American vulnerability. The change from isolationist
American attitudes in the 1920s and '30s was palpable. Government
propaganda explains just a part of this change. The experience of having
been attacked at Pearl Harbor, of having fought in Europe and the
Pacific during World War II, as well as the legacies of an activist
state at home during the New Deal, contributed to making Americans more
interventionist in their approach. Even though those in charge in the
White House were Democratic liberals, they were joined in their Cold War
policies by many Republicans. The Marshall Plan, a massive US investment
in the future of Europe, passed a Republican-controlled House with only
74 members voting against. The assistance to Greece and Turkey was
opposed by 107 congressmen. Even Republicans like Robert Taft, who had
been a standard-bearer for noninterventionism in the 1930s (and who
later was to oppose both NATO and the Korean War) voted for Truman's
economic and military aid plans. From a US perspective, the Cold War was
a bipartisan initiative.</p>
<p>Instead, the main challenge to Truman's decision to confront the Soviet
Union came from the Left. And it was not much of a challenge.
Roosevelt's former secretary of agriculture, Henry Wallace---a
Democratic Party grandee who regarded himself as a leader of the
Left---decided to form a separate party for the presidential elections
in 1948. "The bigger the peace vote in 1948," Wallace said in declaring
his candidacy, "the more definitely the world will know that the United
States is not behind the bi-partisan reactionary war policy which is
dividing the world into two armed camps and making inevitable the day
when American soldiers will be lying in their Arctic suits in the
Russian snow."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en091en">^2^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en091}
Even though it was supported by some Democrats who felt that Truman was
moving away from the legacies of the New Deal by breaking the wartime
alliance with the USSR, Wallace's campaign was undermined by his own
haplessness as a candidate and the rather shrill US Communist Party
support for his cause. To everyone's surprise, Truman narrowly won the
election against the Republican Thomas Dewey. Wallace's Progressives
scored 2.5 percent of the vote, less than Strom Thurmond's Southern
segregationists ticket.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-103}Truman's second-term foreign policy was
marked by increasing tension with the Soviets, the collapse of a
US-supported government in China, and the outbreak of the Korean War.
This was the time when the Cold War was militarized, both from a Soviet
and American perspective. Truman's administration struggled to put
together a comprehensive and global strategy for fighting what everyone
hoped would remain a shadow war with the Soviets. There was never much
doubt in the president's mind that the struggle was <em>both</em> against the
Soviet Union and Communism globally. And he had little time for those
among his own advisers---such as George Kennan---who warned against a
global militarization of the conflict. Kennan was replaced as director
of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff in 1949, and his
successor, the more hawkish Paul Nitze, put together a document that
attempted to set out a US Cold War
strategy.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en092en">^3^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en092} Later
known as NSC-68, the paper was radical in its recommendations and would
probably not have come to reflect the Administration's policies if it
had not been for the outbreak of the Korean War three months after it
was first presented.</p>
<p>The direction of NSC-68 focused on the need for dramatic increases in US
defense spending and on American willingness to intervene globally. It
encouraged economic and psychological warfare as well as covert
operations to target the Soviet enemy and its allies. It wanted a
dramatic increase in US intelligence-gathering capabilities and in money
spent on internal security and civil defense. It was even foolhardy
enough to suggest that tax increases and cuts in domestic programs would
be necessary to pay for these expenses. The purpose was to put the
United States on war footing in a conflict that could last for a very
long time.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-104}Still, the most striking aspect of NSC-68
was not its practical suggestions but the view of the enemy that it
represented. "The defeat of Germany and Japan and the decline of the
British and French Empires have interacted with the development of the
United States and the Soviet Union in such a way that power increasingly
gravitated to these two centers," Nitze and his colleagues explained.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
The Soviet Union, unlike previous aspirants to hegemony, is animated by
a new fanatic faith, anti-thetical to our own, and seeks to impose its
absolute authority over the rest of the world. Conflict has, therefore,
become endemic and is waged, on the part of the Soviet Union, by violent
or non-violent methods in accordance with the dictates of expediency....
The [Soviet] design... calls for the complete subversion or forcible
destruction of the machinery of government and structure of society in
the countries of the non-Soviet world and their replacement by an
apparatus and structure subservient to and controlled from the Kremlin.
To that end Soviet efforts are now directed toward the domination of the
Eurasian land mass. The United States, as the principal center of power
in the non-Soviet world and the bulwark of opposition to Soviet
expansion, is the principal enemy whose integrity and vitality must be
subverted or destroyed by one means or another if the Kremlin is to
achieve its fundamental design.... Our free society finds itself
mortally challenged by the Soviet system. No other value system is so
wholly irreconcilable with ours, so implacable in its purpose to destroy
ours, so capable of turning to its own uses the most dangerous and
divisive trends in our own society, no other so skillfully and
powerfully evokes the elements of irrationality in human nature
everywhere, and no other has the support of a great and growing center
of military
power.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en093en">^4^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en093}
:::</p>
<p>The long-term US aim, NSC-68 maintained, is to create "a fundamental
change in the nature of the Soviet system, a change toward which the
frustration of the design is the first and perhaps the most important
step. Clearly it will not only be less costly but more effective if this
change occurs to a maximum extent as a result of internal forces in
Soviet society." But to begin with the United States should concentrate
on internal and external defense:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-105}It is quite clear from Soviet theory and
practice that the Kremlin seeks to bring the free world under its
dominion by the methods of the cold war. The preferred technique is to
subvert by infiltration and intimidation. Every institution of our
society is an instrument which it is sought to stultify and turn against
our purposes. Those that touch most closely our material and moral
strength are obviously the prime targets, labor unions, civic
enterprises, schools, churches, and all media for influencing opinion.
The effort is not so much to make them serve obvious Soviet ends as to
prevent them from serving our ends, and thus to make them sources of
confusion in our economy, our culture, and our body
politic.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en094en">^5^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en094}
:::</p>
<p>As a document, NSC-68 was itself a product of a new US foreign policy
coordination process centered on the White House. The National Security
Council (NSC) was set up by President Truman in 1947 in order to link
the various foreign policy, military, and intelligence bodies within the
executive branch. At first the NSC was intended primarily as a step
toward providing better and more consistent advice to the president.
But, bowing to bureaucratic necessities, it increasingly took on key
functions of consultation, deliberation, and---at least to some
extent---policy-making. As the Cold War intensified, the NSC became the
main coordinating body for how to conduct it within the US government.
On intelligence, likewise, Truman aimed for centralization and
effectivization. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), established by
the same act that set up the NSC, aimed at bringing together the various
intelligence-gathering bureaus and agencies that existed within the US
government. In this it failed, since different branches of military
intelligence as well as the signals intelligence bureau (later renamed
the National Security Agency, or NSA) remained outside CIA purview. But
the new agency still became a key instrument of US Cold War
capabilities, both through spying and through covert operations.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-106}<strong>A[S]{.small-caps} US
[CAPACITY]{.small-caps}</strong> increased and expanded, so Britain's decreased
and contracted. The agenda for the British government in the late 1940s
and early 1950s was much narrower than its victory in World War II
should have allowed for. Britain was still a great power with global
interests. But it did not have the economic capacity to sustain its
status for much longer. As the war ended, Britain was broke. It had lost
one quarter of its national wealth, meaning that its expenditure for
World War II was roughly twice that of World War I. When Churchill had
spoken of all-out mobilization against the Nazis, his government had
really meant it: Britain had borrowed (from the Americans), sold off
foreign assets, and sacrificed civilian production at home to keep the
war going. It had won, but at a cost that was too great to bear for
Britain's prewar position. In order to pay back its debts and rebuild at
home---not to mention prepare for the welfare state that the Labour
government had promised---the UK had to introduce rationing for most
goods and cut back dramatically on its overseas military engagements.
Still, it was not enough. People had to line up for hours in order to
get basic supplies. Bombed-out Londoners had to wait on average seven
years to get a new
home.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en095en">^6^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en095}</p>
<p>Politically, Clement Attlee's government was caught in a quandary. For a
while it kept on pretending that Britain could be the balancing force on
the European continent, helping to contain Communism, while gradually
allowing for more freedoms in the Empire and building a welfare state at
home. In reality it had to choose, and---understandably enough---opted
for the latter. By 1950 the British withdrawal from east of Suez was in
full swing; India and Pakistan had become independent in 1947, southeast
Asia was soon to follow, and Britain's position in the Middle East and
the Mediterranean was much reduced. One should be careful, though, with
making Britain's international weakness in the 1950s total: it still had
one of the largest armies and navies in the world, it had the prestige
of having stood up to Hitler when nobody else would or could, and it
had---successfully it seemed---hitched its wagon to that of the world's
main power, the United States. The British may have felt that they were
treated dismally by their big ally and resented the slide in their
country's international prestige. But, whether they voted Labour or
Conservative, they were also aware that they were getting something
back: free medical care for all, universal pensions, and family
allowances mattered in what was still one of the most class-ridden
societies on earth.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-107}If life in Britain was topsy-turvy after
the war, its former enemy had had its existence almost obliterated.
Germany was a wreck in 1945, and it took a long time for its people to
begin moving out of the physical and psychological ruins Hitler had left
behind. Even though German industrial production in 1945 was less than
20 percent of what it had been before the war, the psychological scars
were worse than the material destruction. The Germans had, in 1933,
joined up with a disastrous political project. Right to the end of the
war they had embraced the lie, and the Nazi breakdown was therefore
utterly demoralizing. What was the purpose of work, if death and
devastation were its wages? Getting any form of economic activity going
again in post-war Germany was difficult, and in the first years Germans
were dependent on handouts from the victorious powers. The only way of
obtaining goods beyond the bare necessities was through the black
market.</p>
<p>The allies had a hard time deciding what to do with Germany. The French
and some Americans suggested its total dismemberment as a state; one
American plan proposed the abolition of its industrial potential and its
reinvention as an agricultural economy. Agreeing to zones of occupation
was the easy part at first. The Soviets got 40 percent in the east
(reduced to 28 percent when Stalin transferred German territory to
Poland). The remainder was shared between Britain (in the northwest),
the United States (in the south), and a smaller zone in the southwest
for France. Very soon the discussion about Germany's long-term future
was overwhelmed by its immediate needs. None of the occupying powers
wanted to contribute more to the German economy than what they were
getting out of it---"paying reparations to the Germans," as the
cash-strapped British put it. To make things worse for the western
Allies, the Potsdam agreements allowed the Soviets to receive some of
their reparations from the western zones. So while the Americans in
reality were paying for the upkeep of the former enemy, the
Soviets---who contributed much less in their zone---were busy
dismantling surviving German industries in the Ruhr and shipping them
east.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-108}In May 1946 the US military governor,
General Lucius D. Clay, unilaterally suspended reparation deliveries
from the American zone. The British did the same three months later. The
Soviets were furious, but could do little about it. Neither could they
hinder the Americans and the British from joining their two zones, for
economic purposes, at the end of 1946. The so-called Bizonia was
supposed to be a temporary measure. But in reality it laid the
foundation for a separate West German state. At the Moscow foreign
ministers' meeting in March 1947, it became clear that both the two main
western allies were edging closer to Kennan's view from 1945, when he
had argued that "we have no choice but to lead our section of Germany...
to a form of independence so prosperous, so secure, so superior, that
the East cannot threaten
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en096en">^7^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en096} By mid-1947,
after the authorities in Bizonia had in effect given up on the
de-Nazification of German industry, some economic activity had restarted
in western Germany, but it did still not show any signs of an economic
recovery.</p>
<p>As on so many other matters, Stalin found it difficult to decide what
Soviet postwar policy toward Germany should be. He had learned from his
mentor Lenin that Germany was the big prize for socialism in Europe;
only with a Communist Germany, Lenin had believed, could the Soviet
Union continue to exist in the long run. But instead of going socialist,
Germany had been taken over by the Nazis in the 1930s and, after
Stalin's attempts at accommodation had failed, had started a war in
which the USSR itself almost succumbed. Even in defeat, Germany was
therefore a big opportunity as well as a big danger. If a neutral
Germany could gradually be linked to the Soviet Union, then the Cold War
in Europe would be won. But if the Americans succeeded in turning the
part of Germany it occupied---the richest and best developed part---into
an arsenal for a US-led attack on the USSR, then Communism would be
stamped out. Stalin therefore had to be cautious not to misstep, again,
on Germany.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-109}As so often happens, indecision led to
passivity. For a crucial year Stalin let events in Germany float. He
allowed his soldiers to introduce a regime of terror in the east, not
exactly conducive to the future establishment of socialism. He seemed
more preoccupied with looting what could be of use to the Soviets than
with establishing order in his occupation zone. If the Soviet zone,
after the initial chaos, for a while seemed to work better than the
west, this was due not so much to Stalin as to Red Army administrators
and the German Communists who had come back with them. They were more
than ready to take over the centralized planning systems that had
existed in Nazi Germany and to rely on them in order to get basic
infrastructure and production going wherever possible. After a while
former Nazi officials at the lower levels---those the Soviets decided
not to put on trial---also found it remarkably easy to collaborate; the
Communist ideas of planning were not, after all, that different from
those of their former masters.</p>
<p>Publicly, however, the new east German authorities held high the banner
of anti-Fascism. They were the "good Germans"; the bad Germans, plenty
of them, were all collaborating in the western occupation zones, or so
German Communist propaganda claimed. Many Left-wing Germans fell for the
disinformation, especially intellectuals and artists, some of whom moved
east, including top names in German literature like Stefan Heym and
Bertolt Brecht, who both moved there from wartime exile in the United
States. In the spring of 1946 the Soviets and the German Communists
forced the Social Democrats in the east into a Socialist Unity Party
(SED), in which the Communists under Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht
had full control. Again, some non-Communist Left-wingers joined
enthusiastically, believing that they thereby made up for the failure of
the German Left to cooperate against Hitler in the 1930s. Most Social
Democrats were made of sterner stuff, however, and fought to keep their
party separate, even if it meant relocating to the western occupation
zones. Still, the SED scored enough successes for Stalin to be convinced
that there would be a future for Soviet political influence in a united
Germany.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-110}The reasons why Stalin wanted a united
Germany were exactly the same reasons why the United States, by 1947,
did not. A functional German state would have to be integrated with
western Europe in order to succeed, Washington found. And that could not
be achieved if Soviet influence grew throughout the country. This was
not only a point about security. It was also about economic progress.
The Marshall Plan was intended to stimulate western European growth
through market integration, and the western occupation zones in Germany
were crucial for this project to succeed. Better, then, to keep the
eastern zone (and thereby Soviet pressure) out of the equation. After
two meetings of the allied foreign ministers in 1947 had failed to agree
on the principles for a peace treaty with Germany (and thereby German
reunification), the Americans called a conference in London in February
1948 to which the Soviets were not invited. Before the meeting started,
it was clear that the Americans and British had agreed between
themselves on German currency reform and on elections in Bizonia. The
French reluctantly joined in the plans. As Bevin explained to
Parliament,</p>
<p>::: blockquote
Germany cannot be allowed to remain a slum in the centre of Europe. On
the contrary, our policy is that she must contribute to her own recovery
and keep herself, and give her share to European recovery. That is the
best way to get Germany to make reparations for the devastation that she
caused in the war. In accordance, therefore, with the London
recommendations, Germany has been incorporated into the European
Recovery Programme [the Marshall Plan].... She will receive her share
of aid under this programme, but in turn she must produce and be enabled
to pay her share into the common pool. She cannot do it unless we
proceed apace with economic rehabilitation. We must give her the tools
to work with if she is to make a
contribution.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en097en">^8^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en097}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-111}The division of Germany was therefore in
some respects a result of the Marshall Plan. The United States regarded
it as crucial to its own security to get the European economies going
again. The Soviet Union and the Communist governments had,
understandably, no wish to join in European recovery plans headed by the
United States and implemented by US officials. The necessity of
including the western part of Germany, under control of the western
Allies, into the Marshall Plan therefore meant its separation from the
east. The new deutschmark was a symbol of this division, and it was a
dramatic step. First the western Allies agreed on a new German central
bank. Then, in June 1948, they wiped out public and private debt by
setting ceilings on how much old currency could be fully converted into
Deutschmark. And then they pegged the new currency to the US dollar at a
low exchange rate, while abolishing price controls in the western zones.
The effects were spectacular. Overnight the black market virtually
disappeared. Goods reappeared in the shops and production began to
increase. Workers were unhappy because their wages did not increase. And
savers were furious because---for the second time in the lifetimes of
some---their savings were decimated. Angriest of all were the Soviets,
who were now forced to introduce a separate currency in the east in
order to prevent their zone being flooded with the former currency, now
worthless in the west.</p>
<p>West German currency reform was an integral part of the Marshall Plan,
which in itself was a part of the integration of western Europe into a
US-led capitalist economy. It was the completion of a process that had
begun in the early part of the twentieth century, with the gradual
transfer of technology, production, and management methods, and
instruments for trade and investment. But it was also a response to the
crisis that had been created by depression and world war. Like the New
Deal in the United States, the Marshall Plan was an attempt at getting
production going again, using whatever instruments were available. US
advisers, many of whom were old New Dealers themselves, were willing to
accept European government controls, planning, and even nationalizations
if it helped put people back to work and bring goods to market. At the
core of the project, though, was the realization that the capitalist
market had not existed in Europe during the war and had mostly been a
disaster before it. If markets, banking, and belief in private property
were to be resurrected, the United States had to offer economic
assistance to Europe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-112}It is hard to say exactly how much
Marshall Plan aid assisted with European postwar recovery, in spite of
its \$12 billion size (roughly \$150 billion in today's money)---about
1.5 percent of the US GDP per year. It is likely that some growth would
have begun anyway, though more in some countries and regions than
others. But its psychological effect was massive everywhere. Western
Europeans started believing in public and private institutions again,
making spending possible and increasing employment and productivity. In
economic terms, it made up for the trade deficits with the United
States, which otherwise would have had a debilitating effect on European
economies. It made claims for reparations from Germany less important.
And it abated balance of payment difficulties between European
countries, helping to get inter-European trade going again. Between 1947
and 1951 production grew on average 55 percent in Marshall Plan
countries.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en098en">^9^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en098}</p>
<p>The recipients at first approached US offers of aid gingerly. Some did
not like the inclusion of Germany. Others believed that it amounted to a
wholesale US takeover of the European economies. Resistance was found
mostly at the far side of the Right and the Left. The Communists
protested---violently, in some cases, as when dockworkers in Marseilles
and Naples prevented the off-loading of American ships. "The European
worker listens listlessly while we tell him we are saving Europe,
unconvinced that it is his Europe we are saving," according to one US
Marshall Plan
official.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en099en">^10^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en099} But
traditional European elites were not too happy, either. They felt that
the Americans were out to upset established social order and wipe out
their positions within their own societies. They saw American table
manners, raunchy music, and black soldiers as a threat to their European
culture.</p>
<p>The meeting of minds was most often between American officials and the
emerging European Christian Democrat or Social Democrat leaders. The
Americans insisted that the Europeans themselves should decide on the
details of how Marshall Plan funds should be spent, within the
frameworks established by Washington. In Britain, some of the funds were
used for food imports, alleviating the shortages created by the war. In
Germany and France much money was spent on the import of heavy machinery
to restart industries. Everywhere governments used the new funds
available for reconstructing what the war had destroyed; photos of
smiling families in front of their new apartment block rising from the
rubble were much used to counter Communist slogans that the Marshall
Plan was simply preparation for a new war. The budget guarantees US aid
offered enabled western European governments to begin constructing their
modern welfare states; without it, there certainly would not have been
the surpluses necessary for new social expenditure or, for that matter,
for government investments in infrastructure, which helped tie the
western part of the continent together.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-113}For Americans and western European
governments alike, a major part of the Marshall Plan was combatting
local Communist parties. Some of it was done directly, through
propaganda. Other effects on the political balance were secondary or
even coincidental. A main reason why Soviet-style Communism lost out in
France or Italy was simply that their working classes began to have a
better life, at first more through government social schemes than
through salary increases. The political miscalculations of the Communist
parties and the pressure they were under from Moscow to disregard the
local political situation in order to support the Soviet Union also
contributed. When even the self-inflicted damage was not enough, such as
in Italy, the United States experimented with covert operations to break
Communist influence. The Italian election in April 1948 pitted a
US-funded Christian Democracy, heavily supported by the Catholic Church
and the Vatican, against a Soviet-funded and Communist-led Popular
Democratic Front. Both camps were led by Italians from outside Italy:
the Christian Democrat leader Alcide De Gasperi, born in Austria and not
an Italian citizen until he was almost forty, against Palmiro Togliatti,
the Communist leader who had spent almost twenty years in exile in the
USSR. The CIA got Italian-Americans to write letters to their relatives
at home, agitating against the Communist threat, while engaging in dirty
tricks' campaigns against Communist candidates. In the end the Christian
Democrats won almost 50 percent of the vote. They would probably have
won anyway, since the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia two months before
drove a lot of voters away from the Left. But the 1948 elections
symbolized the first occasion when the CIA had engaged in a big covert
operation against its enemies, and the Agency was very pleased with the
result.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-114}In France the Communist Party had been
thrown out of government in May 1947 after they refused to support the
French reconquest of its Indochinese colonies. The French Communists,
led by Maurice Thorez, had long been caught between being a responsible
party leading the country and getting a more radical course of change.
Their position in France was very strong; the sense that the old elites
had failed during the war drove young people to the Communist party. Its
support among intellectuals and students was particularly powerful, but
it also had a solid working class base in the trade unions. In addition,
it was helped by the positive image of the Soviet Union held by many
French people---the Soviets had, after all, defeated Nazi Germany (which
France itself had spectacularly failed to do). Even anti-Communist
intellectuals such as Raymond Aron admitted that "every action, in the
middle of the twentieth century, presupposes and involves the adoption
of an attitude with regard to the Soviet
enterprise."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en100en">^11^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en100} But
the French Communists went so far in supporting the Soviet Union's
ever-changing policies that they isolated themselves, in spite of being
the biggest political party and the only one with mass popular support.
They got no succor from Stalin. The Boss "considers the policy of the
Fr[ench] party entirely wrong," the former Comintern chief Georgi
Dimitrov wrote in his diary after another evening of drinking at
Stalin's dacha. "Its leaders have fallen prey to the fear that France
would collapse without American credits. The Communists should have left
the government with the explanation that they are against the betrayal
of France's independence, instead of waiting to be thrown
out."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en101en">^12^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en101}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-115}Stalin's advice to the French showed him
at his most disingenuous. In 1945 he had advised the French Communist
Party (PCF) to work within a parliamentary system. With Great Power
relations in tatters, he now turned on them because they had followed
Soviet instructions. But he was right about the rest of French politics
(except the Communists, who remained his most loyal followers whatever
opprobrium he threw at their party). The new French leaders---General
Charles de Gaulle, who had resigned in a huff in 1946, and those of the
Fourth Republic who followed him---were entirely dependent on US aid.
Since almost all Frenchmen still believed that their country was a Great
Power, this was a difficult position to be in. Germany had humiliated
France in 1940. The United States was, in the eyes of many Frenchmen,
humiliating France now simply by being in a so much more powerful
position than France itself was. "The United States... is infatuated
with its own weight," wrote the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. "The
richer it is, the heavier it is. Weighed down with fat and pride, it
lets itself be rolled towards war with its eyes
closed."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en102en">^13^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en102}</p>
<p>But while French anti-Americanism was shared by many Frenchmen outside
of the Communist Party, its government became increasingly closely
linked with the United States. Marshall Plan aid was crucial for France,
which mostly spent it making long overdue investments in French
industry, thereby laying the groundwork for an industrial revival in the
1950s. But the links with Washington were also essential in security
terms. The leaders of the Fourth Republic knew that in case of war the
Red Army would be heading straight for Paris. American influence may be
a danger to France's soul, but Soviet power was a danger to its heart.
And France needed assistance against what its leaders saw as a distinct
security threat. In March 1948 its government signed the Brussels Pact
with Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, providing for
mutual assistance in case of an attack by others. But it was clear to
many non-Communist French leaders---with Soviet forces standing only one
hundred miles from the Rhine---that this was not enough. After the
Czechoslovak coup and the crises over Germany, French leaders who at
first had wanted to work with the Communists---such as the wartime head
of the French resistance, Georges Bidault, who had insisted on Communist
participation in his postwar government---sought a US commitment to
French security. Bidault became a key figure among European Christian
Democrats in the discussion about a western European defense treaty with
the United States.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-116}The Soviet reaction to western economic
policies in Germany helped convince French leaders that the Soviets and
not the Germans would be the biggest threat to their country's security
in the future. Stalin was furious about the introduction of the
deutschmark and what he saw as US attempts at keeping Germany divided
for its own purposes. He wanted to strike back, but in a manner that did
not risk outright war with the western countries. The German strategy
arrived at in Moscow in 1948 was split into many different parts. Stalin
wanted to solidify his grip on the east by taking full control of
Berlin. He also began reaching out to "real Germans," as he put it,
those who had followed Hitler and the NSDAP, through Soviet-sanctioned
nationalist propaganda in Germany against the United States. If German
nationalism could prevent US control of western Germany, then it would
objectively serve Soviet interests. The National Democratic Party of
Germany, set up under Communist control in the east in order to attract
former Nazis to the Soviet cause, declared in its program: "America
violated the Treaty of Potsdam and plunged us Germans... in the biggest
national distress of our history.... But the American war may and shall
not take place! Germany must live! That's why we National Democrats
demand: the Americans to America. Germany for the Germans.... Peace,
independence and prosperity for our entire German
fatherland."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en103en">^14^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en103}</p>
<p>Alongside their propaganda for a plebiscite on the unification and
neutrality of Germany, Soviet and German Communists developed a somewhat
rudimentary plan for forcing the western powers out of Berlin. Stalin
had stressed the centrality of Communist control of Berlin in order to
show the Germans that unification could only happen under the auspices
of the Soviet Union. In the spring of 1948 Red Army commanders had
started harassing western Allied transports heading in and out of the
German capital. In June, after the introduction of the new currency, the
Soviets prohibited its use in Berlin and threatened sanctions against
the western zones. With Berlin as an island within Soviet-held
territory, such threats held some credibility. When the deutschmark
started appearing in Berlin, the Soviets cut off all surface traffic
between western Germany and the capital. In the days that followed they
also terminated all deliveries of food or electricity to western Berlin.
Stalin had decided on the first real showdown of the Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-117}The Berlin blockade, which lasted for
almost a year, was a Soviet political failure from start to finish. It
failed to make west Berlin destitute; a US and British air-bridge
provided enough supplies to keep the western sectors going. On some days
aircraft landed at Tempelhof Airport at three minute intervals. Moscow
did not take the risk of ordering them to be shot down. But worse for
Stalin: the long-drawn-out standoff confirmed even to those Germans who
had previously been in doubt that the Soviet Union could not be a
vehicle for their betterment. The perception was that Stalin was trying
to starve the Berliners, while the Americans were trying to save them.
On the streets of Berlin more than half a million protested Soviet
policies. When the SED chased councilors from other parties out of City
Hall, located in east Berlin, they reconvened in the west and elected a
Social Democrat mayor, the formidable trade unionist Ernst Reuter.
Communist and Social Democrat workers fought each other in the streets,
with the latter giving as good as they got. The young Willy Brandt, a
German Social Democrat who had taken up arms against Hitler's regime and
who returned to Berlin in 1946 as a Norwegian officer, helped organize
the resistance. But even he was in doubt about the final outcome: "Would
the western democracies risk a world war in the interest of a few
million Berliners?" Brandt
wrote.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en104en">^15^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en104}</p>
<p>The need to reassure not just Berliners but other Europeans about US
staying power was a key reason why the Truman Administration in the fall
of 1948 began discussing a formal alliance treaty with the countries in
western Europe. The President was fully aware of how difficult such a
process would be. Americans were not naturally given to forming foreign
alliances in peacetime---its founding fathers had warned against any
"entangling alliances," especially with European powers. Many voters
were resentful of the United States taking on Europe's problems and
paying for them through their tax bill. And a majority of Americans were
still against any permanent foreign stationing of US troops. Opinion in
western Europe was also divided. Some believed that their countries
should try to act as a bridge between Soviets and Americans, and not
join one side against the other. For people on the Left, especially, it
was tough to consider joining the United States---a country they saw as
the home of freewheeling capitalism---in an alliance against eastern
Europeans who themselves professed to be socialists.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-118}But by 1949 fear seemed to rule out all
other considerations. Truman managed to get a coalition together in
Congress for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an integrated
alliance that included a mutual defense obligation. Though much time was
spent in Washington on discussing who in Europe could join, what was
most remarkable was how European governments lined up to get inside
quick. In Italy and France, their Christian Democrat and liberal
governments delivered their countries for NATO. In Britain and the Low
Countries both labor parties and conservatives were in favor. Even in
Scandinavia, with its long tradition of neutrality, Danish and Norwegian
Social Democrats steamrolled applications for membership through their
parliaments. The Norwegian ambassador to the United States explained
that "Norway learned her lesson in 1940.... Today [it] does not
believe that neutrality has any relation to the facts of
life."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en105en">^16^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en105} The most
curious addition was Portugal, which was neither a democracy nor a World
War II ally. But both Britain and the United States viewed the
Portuguese Atlantic islands as essential bases in case of a war against
the Soviets. In April 1949 the treaty was signed in Washington.</p>
<p>The initial effects of NATO in Europe were neither military nor
political. They were substantially psychological. Non-Communist western
Europeans started to believe that the United States would not withdraw
from the continent anytime soon. This meant that Europe would remain
divided. But it also meant security against a Soviet attack. The setting
up of NATO was not about a civilizational definition of a European core
("from Plato to NATO," as some put it---even though Greece would not
join until 1952). It was about stability on a continent that had been
going through hell for more than a generation. If the purpose of
NATO---as its first general secretary, Lord Ismay, is said to have
quipped---was to "keep the Americans in, the Soviets out, and the
Germans down," then this was a purpose with which the majority of
western Europeans agreed around 1950. The exception, of course, were the
Communists, who protested everywhere. Togliatti condemned his government
in the Italian parliament: "We say 'no' to the Atlantic Pact, 'no'
because it is a pact of preparation for war. We say 'no' to your policy,
a policy of hostility and aggression against the Soviet Union. We say
'no' to the imperialist intrigues which you are plotting to the harm of
the Italian people, their independence and their liberty, and we shall
do everything in our power to unmask this policy of yours and make it a
failure."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en106en">^17^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en106}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-119}The speed with which NATO was brought
about was in part a reflection of the military weakness of the United
States and its new allies on the ground in Europe. The advice President
Truman had got from the Joint Chiefs of Staff was clear: US troops could
not defend continental western Europe against the Red Army, even if the
atomic bomb were to be used. At best, the Americans would be able to
hold on to bridgeheads in Italy and the French west coast, and help
protect Britain as an air base for bombing raids against the Soviets,
while waiting for reinforcements to arrive from North America. The
Soviets were in a position to establish full control of all of Europe
within less than two months, the Joint Chiefs reported. The Berlin
Blockade had changed the perspectives of the US military dramatically.
General Clay, for instance, told his superiors in Washington of his
feeling that war "may come with dramatic
suddenness."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en107en">^18^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en107}
Although historians have found no evidence of Soviet planning for an
offensive war until the 1950s, and though the alarmism expressed by some
US generals, Clay included, was also fed by their wish for Congress to
approve higher levels of military spending, there is no doubt that there
was a real fear of war among US military planners from mid-1948 on. They
assumed it would be a global war, with Soviet offensives not just in
Europe, but in the Middle East and east Asia, too. US war planning was
itself increasingly global, implying an almost universal perception of
threat as well as an expansion of US capabilities, especially in terms
of aerial warfare. But underlying it all was also a rising assumption of
US global interest, in which events in Europe and North America were
linked to those in other parts of the world in a systemic sense.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-120}With preparations for war came fears of
domestic subversion. The link had been made many times before in US
history: the Red Scare after World War I or the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II were just recent examples. The
public witch hunt against Communists and other Left-wingers in the 1940s
and 1950s had equally damaging effects. Charges of disloyalty, most of
which were entirely unfounded, drove many knowledgeable and gifted
experts away from government service. Joseph McCarthy, the demagogic and
hyperbolic Wisconsin senator who through his speeches on the Senate
floor came to symbolize anti-Communist paranoia, did more damage to US
interests than any of Stalin's covert operations. In February 1950
McCarthy claimed that he had evidence of 205---later corrected to
57---Communists working in the State Department, and denounced the
president as a traitor who "sold out the Christian world to the
atheistic
world."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en108en">^19^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en108} The
series of hearings and investigations, which accusations such as
McCarthy's gave rise to, destroyed people's lives and careers. Even for
those who were cleared, such as the famous central Asia scholar Owen
Lattimore, some of the accusations stuck and made it difficult to find
employment. It was, as Lattimore said in his book title from 1950,
<em>Ordeal by Slander</em>. For many of the lesser known who were
targeted---workers, actors, teachers, lawyers---it was a Kafkaesque
world, where their words were twisted and used against them during
public hearings by people who had no knowledge of the victims or their
activities. Behind all of it was the political purpose of harming the
Administration, though even some Democrats were caught up in the frenzy
and the president himself straddled the issue instead of publicly
confronting McCarthy. McCarthyism, as it was soon called, reduced the US
standing in the world and greatly helped Soviet propaganda, especially
in western Europe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-121}One effect of McCarthyism was that public
hysteria made investigations into genuine spy networks more difficult.
Since the 1930s there had been a substantial Soviet intelligence
presence in the United States, just as in the main European countries.
These agents---some ideological, some blackmailed or bribed---had
provided important information to Moscow during World War II, and their
activities were stepped up as the Cold War took hold. Stalin demanded
that the Soviet intelligence services---known for most of the Cold War
as the Committee for State Security (KGB) and its military counterpart,
the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Red Army (GRU)---deliver
information about US war plans against the USSR. Because of the rising
frenzy in the United States, Communists or ex-Communists were easy
targets to recruit. A British spy of German origin, the physicist Klaus
Fuchs, provided intelligence on the US nuclear project on which he
worked. Fuchs continued to spy after returning to Britain in 1946 until
he was arrested in 1950. There were several hundred such spies in the
United States, though few as important as Fuchs. As US
counterintelligence in the late 1940s gradually cracked Soviet codes---a
top-secret enterprise known as Operation Venona---many of these spies
were arrested. But since Venona was to be kept secret (even, it turned
out, from President Truman), its results did little to allay public
fears of Communist subversion.</p>
<p>The alarm that the Cold War created in the United States paled in
comparison to the spasms that the Soviet Union and eastern Europe went
through. Up to Stalin's death in 1953, denunciations, purges, and show
trials were the order of the day. This was of course nothing new in
Soviet history; in many ways it was a repeat of what had happened on
several occasions since the Bolshevik revolution and that had peaked in
Stalin's great terror of the 1930s. World War II had intensified
Stalin's suspicions and the Cold War brought them to another peak. The
first problem was the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who returned
from German prison camps; could they be trusted? More than a third of
them were marched straight from German to Soviet prison camps. Then
there were those who had lived under German occupation; most were
investigated and many, including all Communist officials there, were
sent to the camps. Even victorious Red Army soldiers returning from the
battlefront were seen as suspect. They may have glimpsed ways of life
abroad that were inconsistent with Soviet visions of the future. One
careless statement about German living standards or Czech culture could
be enough to land them in prison upon their
return.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en109en">^20^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en109}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-122}The worst crime of the Soviet 1940s was
the mass deportations of whole peoples or population groups from the
western USSR to the east. During the war more than a million Soviet
Germans were deported to the east, plus another million Muslims from the
Caucasus and the Crimea (Chechens, Ingush, Kalmyks, Tatars, Turks, and
others). They were regarded as security threats. One-fifth of them died
in the first three years after deportation. Then, as the Red Army
advanced westward in 1944, mass deportations from the Baltic states,
Ukraine, and Belorussia began. In eastern Poland, now incorporated into
the Soviet Union, the Communists completed the Soviet deportations of
the old elite that Hitler had interrupted in 1941. In the early 1950s
the Soviet population controlled by the Chief Directorate of Camps
(GULag) reached its peak of over two and a half million prisoners.</p>
<p>Some groups continued to resist, especially in Ukraine and the Baltic
states. Ukraine, which had been part of the Russian Empire and was taken
over by Communist forces after the 1917 revolution, had come under
German control in 1941, and Ukrainian nationalists used the opportunity
to declare independence from the Soviet Union. While Ukrainian autonomy
remained a sham under German occupation, many Ukrainian nationalists
continued to fight against the Red Army after the Nazi withdrawal. The
Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) existed in the Soviet Union
until 1950, when its leader, Roman Shukhevych, was killed. While the OUN
was feared for its collaboration with the Nazis and its atrocities
against Poles and Jews, some Ukrainians still regarded it as the
champion of independence and sovereignty. Soviet countermeasures were
brutal. Between 1944 and 1952 as many as six hundred thousand people
were arrested in western Ukraine; about a third of these were executed
and the rest imprisoned or exiled. The fierce Soviet response probably
did as much to keep resistance alive as the waning military power of the
OUN.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-123}In the Baltic states---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---the return of the Red Army also provoked lasting
resistance. Having become independent from Russia in 1918, the three
countries were occupied by the Soviets in 1940, after Stalin's pact with
Hitler. The occupation was vicious, and the German invasion in 1941 had
been greeted with relief by many Balts, who now turned their wrath on
Russians and other local minorities, including Jews. The German defeat
meant the return of the Red Army and the start of another round of
bloodletting. In all three Baltic countries resistance coalesced around
former officers, most of whom had collaborated with the Nazis; they were
known collectively as the "Forest Brothers." The fighting lasted for
almost a decade and cost up to fifty thousand lives, mostly in
Lithuania. Around 10 percent of the entire adult population of Balts was
deported or sent to Soviet labor camps between 1940 and 1953.</p>
<p>As had been the case in the 1930s, external pressures led Communism to
turn in on itself in the late 1940s. These inner purges started with the
conflict with Yugoslavia, a completely unnecessary clash that was
created by Stalin's indecision and paranoia. The Yugoslav Communists
were the only eastern European party that had taken power by its own
devices after World War II. Not only had the party's partisans held
their own against the Germans, they had also defeated the Croatian
militias and, after the war ended, the Chetniks under Draža Mihailović,
a conservative, royalist movement mostly of Serbian extraction. The
Yugoslav Communists were led by the flamboyant and energetic Josip Broz,
who called himself Tito, a veteran organizer of mixed Croatian and
Slovene parentage who had spent several years in the Soviet Union. In
1946 Tito had declared a socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
ideologically aligned with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-124}Tito was profuse in his praise of Stalin
and wanted to be known as the keenest and most powerful disciple the
<em>vozhd</em> had in eastern Europe. In the postwar years the Yugoslav
Communists were always the first to criticize what Stalin thought ought
to be criticized, whether it was US policies in Europe or the foibles of
western Communist parties. But Tito's approach awakened Stalin's
suspicions, as did the very fact that the Yugoslav Communists were not
dependent on the Soviets for their power at home. In 1945 Stalin
criticized Tito for his occupation of the Trieste region, which had
created a crisis with the British and the Americans. He also felt that
the Yugoslavs were too radical in supporting the Communist rebellion in
Greece. Most fundamentally, perhaps, the flamboyant, intense personality
of Tito himself irritated Stalin, as did the fierce loyalty the Yugoslav
leader had among his followers. Communism could only have one head,
Stalin thought, and set out to put Tito in his place.</p>
<p>The ostensible cause for the chastising was a plan for a Balkan
federation. Such plans had existed for a very long time, but the fact
that so many countries in the region had turned Communist after 1945
breathed new life into the idea. Both Tito and the Bulgarian Communist
leader Dimitrov had discussed these plans with the Soviets. In September
1946 Stalin had told Dimitrov "that Bulgaria and Yugoslavia will unite
in a common state and play a unified role in the
Balkans."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en110en">^21^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en110} As the
plans matured, the Yugoslavs and the Bulgarians kept the Soviets
informed and sought their advice. Then, out of the blue, Stalin turned
on them. At a hastily convened meeting in Moscow in February 1948, the
Soviet leader accused them of systematic errors and "leftist
infatuations," having taken an "improper and intolerable course" in
planning their
union.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en111en">^22^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en111} The
Bulgarians immediately fell to foot. The Yugoslavs hesitated. Before
they could respond formally, the Soviets unilaterally withdrew all their
advisers from Yugoslavia. A week later Stalin and Molotov sent a letter
in which they claimed that Tito had turned anti-Marxist, that he was
ignoring the class-struggle, and that he was slandering the Soviet
Union. The Balkan federation plans were now used to prove that Tito had
planned to take over neighboring countries. Tito fought back. Having
lived in Moscow during Stalin's purges in the 1930s, he believed that if
he did not, then not just his political career but his life would be
forfeited. In June 1948 the Cominform expelled the Yugoslavs, accusing
them of revisionism and of having instigated a terrorist regime. They
had, the resolution stated, been "betraying the cause of international
solidarity of the working people." It called for "healthy elements"
inside the Yugoslav Communist party to overthrow Tito. The first break
among Communist parties was out in the open.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-125}Stalin had expected Tito's regime to fall
at his command, if not immediately, then during the first few months
after his break with the Yugoslavs. When this did not happen, the
Soviets started a set of purges among Communists elsewhere in eastern
Europe who could be suspected of disobedience, now or in the future. The
victims were chosen more or less randomly, but always among Communists
who had shown initiative of their own and who were popular within their
own parties. Sometimes they were picked because they were easier to
portray as outsiders: Jews, national minorities, or people who had spent
time abroad. In Hungary László Rajk, a Jewish Communist who had fought
in Spain, fitted the pattern perfectly. Rajk, who himself as minister of
the interior had been responsible for sending thousands to their deaths,
was accused of being a Titoist spy and an agent of imperialism. He was
shot in October 1949. In Bulgaria Dimitrov's second in command, Traicho
Kostov, was executed two months later. The two main intended victims in
Poland and Romania, Gomułka and Ana Pauker, survived because it took
time to collect "evidence" against them and Stalin died before their
show trials could begin. Rudolf Slansky, the general secretary of the
Czechoslovak Communist Party, was not so lucky. In his confession, well
rehearsed before the trial, a harrowed Slansky agreed with everything
the prosecution claimed: "As the enemy of the Communist Party and the
people's democratic regime, I formed the Anti-State Conspiratorial
Center at the head of which I stood for several years. In this center of
ours I concentrated a number of various capitalist and
bourgeois-nationalist elements. My collaborators became agents of
imperialist espionage services, that is of the French, English, and
particularly of the American services... aimed at liquidating people's
democratic order [and] restoring capitalism." Slansky was executed in
December 1952.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-126}Utterly unbelievable and therefore
ridiculous, these confessions contributed to the loss of faith in
Communism in western Europe. But in eastern Europe, and in the Soviet
Union itself, it is difficult to say if they made a difference. Unless
one's family or friends were directly hurt by the purges and show
trials, most people chose to concentrate on the reconstruction of their
country, which might give a better life for their children and
grandchildren, if not for themselves. The Communist order seemed there
to stay, and in spite of small signs of everyday resistance to the
dictatorships, conformity ruled. One reason for people's acquiescence
was that the Communist authorities were able to deliver on some of their
social and economic promises, especially during the era of
reconstruction. The Communists were good at coordinating resources
because they had no market or civil society to interfere with their
dispositions. Housing, for instance, was rebuilt more easily in eastern
Europe, even though much of the building was of poor quality. Social
services, such as health care and care for the aged, were developed more
quickly. Overall, the economies of eastern Europe grew more rapidly than
those in the west during the first postwar years. But they started from
a much lower position, and growth was greatest in the least developed
economies (such as Bulgaria) and lowest in the more developed (such as
Czechoslovakia). The fact that the economies grew at all is as much a
testimony to the willingness of ordinary people to work as to Communist
abilities to organize, especially given Soviet looting and the loss of
western markets and technology imports.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union itself it took a long time to improve people's
livelihoods. No other country had suffered the wartime loss of so much
of its productive capacity as the USSR. The first postwar years were
dire; in 1946 there was a famine in parts of the country (unreported, of
course, in Soviet media). Even though the Soviet authorities did not
expect a new war, at least not soon, they liked the wartime command
systems for the economy and kept them in place. The result was an
economic system even more regimented than in the 1930s, with production
quotas set out in miniscule detail. The priority was heavy industry;
steel plants and machinery production were always top of the list.
Still, on its own terms, Soviet output returned to its prewar capacity
remarkably quickly. A significant reason for this was simply peace: in
one way or another Russia had been at war, internally or externally,
through wars, civil war, collectivization, or purges ever since 1914.
Even though Stalin had in no way given up on political campaigns, he
understood that another round of this right after World War II would
have been too much to dish out. With at least the semblance of peace,
Soviet production was able to catch up on the backlog of unrealized
potential and seemingly make great strides from the late 1940s
on.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en112en">^23^</a>{#chapter004.xhtml#en112}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter004.xhtml#page-127}<strong>F[OR MANY PEOPLE,]{.small-caps}</strong>
reconstruction after World War II also meant getting used to a new way
of seeing the world. The Cold War had its roots, of course, in the early
parts of the twentieth century, and as an ideological divide, its shadow
had long fallen on much of European and global history. But it was in
the intense first years after the war that the conflict between
Communism and capitalism was imposed almost everywhere as the
predominant worldwide clash. As people were busy rebuilding their
lives---getting a roof over their heads, feeding their children, finding
work---they found that they were increasingly doing so within a
framework defined by the Cold War. They may not have felt that they were
part of the conflict, but they could not avoid being touched by it. It
created strictures and opportunities they had not seen before, whether
in war or in peace. And gradually, the Cold War connected different
parts of the world in ways and purposes that had not been obvious in the
past.

<p>When World War II ended in Asia, Japan lay with its back broken, and
most of the continent faced profound revolutions. In China, Korea, and
Vietnam, the Communist parties had improved their positions immensely
during the war, and were ready to contest for power. In Indonesia and
India, radical nationalist groups were pushing for full independence
from their Dutch and British colonial masters. The continent was hit by
a perfect storm: not only was Japan gone as an expansionist great power,
but the European empires were breaking down fast as well. For the first
time in at least a hundred years Asians would be able to determine their
own fate, this time under the banners of nationalism and
democracy---concepts first imported from Europe, but given distinct
local twists. The new Asian revolutions did not so much look back as
forward, toward full autonomy, modernization, and state-building.</p>
<p>The revolutionary storm that hit Asia in the wake of the war had three
main currents. The colonial powers and their local allies fought on to
keep their positions, or at least keep some of their economic gain, by
handing over power to elites with whom they could negotiate. But their
front lines were broken; in China all foreign privileges had already
been handed back during the war (except in Hong Kong and Macao), and in
India the British---as a measure of desperation at a time when Japan was
set to invade from the east---had promised autonomy to the country after
the war was over. The two new Superpowers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, both opposed colonialism (at least as long as it was not
their own) and pushed for rapid and full European withdrawals. Most
important of all, no European country could any longer afford to keep
its colonial system in place; their populations wanted reconstruction at
home, not further expenditure on what seemed futile and morally
indefensible positions abroad. Within a decade, colonialism had gone
from being the pride of most Europeans to one of their many problems.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-130}Across Asia, nationalist movements were
positioning themselves to take power. Most of their leaders combined
ideas of a nation, often represented by its past glory, with concepts of
modernization and state planning. Many had some form of socialist
orientation, though their contacts with the Soviet Union had been
limited. In the two biggest countries, China and India, the main
nationalist groups (the Chinese National People's Party, or Guomindang,
and the Indian National Congress) were large organizations with many
factions, both headed by charismatic leaders. Their political
orientations were based on state-centered systems of planning under a
strong executive, but both confronted the Communist parties within their
own borders. In Indonesia---an archipelago of seventeen thousand islands
with diverse cultures and histories---the imagined new state was based
on an entirely new concept of nation, a national homeland for all
indigenous people, with its core in the colony the Dutch had put
together in the nineteenth century. The creators of the Indonesian idea
were fueled by the notion that in southeast Asia the concepts of being
indigenous and being Muslim were identical, and that all southeast Asian
Muslims belonged in one united, centralized state. Just at the time when
the Cold War came to dominate international affairs, Asian nationalists
saw their new nations breaking through.</p>
<p>In all key Asian countries from Japan to Iran, Communist parties emerged
from World War II as the main alternative to the nationalist movements.
Ordered by the Comintern to oppose the Japanese in the east, most
Communists there had been able to gain patriotic credentials of their
own during World War II. But, even so, they were not able to cooperate
easily with the more nativist nationalist leaders, in
part---ironically---because some nationalists believed the Communists'
war efforts had been dictated by Soviet and not national aims. In some
places, where the Japanese had been seen as harbingers of an
anti-European revolt, the Communists were seen as untrustworthy allies
of Asian nationalism. Even so, the Communist parties had expanded
everywhere. In China the party claimed to have a million members and a
large army under its command. In Indonesia the party was the largest
political organization in the country (in spite of its leaders'
political incompetence). In India the party dominated the trade unions
and had significant influence in the most populous region, Bengal. Even
in Japan the party polled more than 10 percent support in the first
election after the new constitution. While still minorities, the
Communists had reason to believe that they would play a major role in
guiding the future destinies of their countries.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-131}The strategic situation in Asia in 1945 is
easy to sum up. In the east, US forces had occupied Japan, landed fifty
thousand troops in China, and taken control of Korea south of the
thirty-eighth parallel. As part of the war, the United States had also
landed soldiers on islands in the larger region, from Okinawa to Borneo,
and across the Pacific. Britain, with Australian help, had taken over
the main cities in southeast Asia from the Japanese. After they finally
entered the war against Japan on 9 August 1945, the Soviets had
conducted a three-week blitzkrieg, ending up in possession of all of the
Chinese northeast (Manchuria), the islands north of Japan, and the
northern half of Korea. In the west, Britain and the Soviets had already
invaded and occupied Iran in mid-1941, with the Soviets holding the
areas north of Tehran. The British were in charge of the rest of the
Middle East. It was the imperialist powers that had benefitted the most
from the collapse of Japan and Germany, but it was also clear that the
British were grossly overextended in 1945. They could not even take
effective control of their own former Asian colonies, not to mention
independent Asian states or those colonies that had belonged to others.
Just like in Europe, Britain needed the cooperation of other
powers---predominantly, the United States---to pursue its interests in
Asia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-132}Immediately after 1945, US policy-makers
were as preoccupied with parts of Asia as they were with Europe. The
United States had, after all, fought World War II because it was
attacked by an Asian power. The Americans had had 350,000 casualties in
all in the Pacific war, and the sacrifice was not easily forgotten.
Twenty thousand of the deaths occurred in the battle for one southern
Japanese island, Okinawa, in mid-1945. The future of Japan after
capitulation was understandably seen as crucial for the United States,
but so was the future of China, whose cause many Americans had felt
intimately connected to as an ally during the war. On the western side
of the continent, the United States saw Iran as a key state for the
years to come; the country had a long border with the Soviet Union and
was the most powerful in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region. American
leaders believed they could help rescue the Iranians from the clutches
of foreign imperialism, British or Soviet, and secure stable oil
supplies for its European allies in the process. In addition to
historical and strategic reasons for US involvement, US leaders often
believed that they could contribute to the political and economic
modernization of Asia after the war in ways no European power could or
would. If Asia was ripe for revolution, Washington wanted to be at the
forefront of it, helping to lead the world's most populous continent in
the direction of independence, wealth, and modernity.</p>
<p>The United States was the main ally of the western European countries in
the Cold War, and especially of Britain and France, the two powers that
had the largest colonial empires. But colonialism as a principle was not
popular in the United States in 1945, since most people saw it as
conflicting with the principles of democratic government and with the
cause of freedom, in which name the war had been fought. Like its
predecessor, the Truman Administration at the end of the Pacific War
wanted to see a speedy transfer of power to local elites in Asia, and it
was willing to challenge its European allies to reach that aim. But it
was not only high principle that led US policy. The Americans also
wanted access to market opportunities that colonial preferences had
barred them from during the interwar years. And they were fretful about
the opportunities that could be given to radicals and Communists if
independence for the colonies were too long postponed; the self-centered
Europeans, the State Department often argued, could not see the larger
Cold War implications of their actions. The universalist heart of the
Cold War drove Americans to have strong views on countries and
territories that had, only a few years earlier, meant little to
Washington.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-133}For the Soviet Union, revolution in Asia
meant both opportunities and risks. Lenin had taught that although Marx
had been right in putting European revolutions at the center of the
overthrow of capitalism, supporting national movements in Asia was a way
of putting pressure on the whole imperialist system. Such assistance
could thereby hasten the revolutions in Europe that were key both to
Soviet security and to the future of humankind. Stalin had taken over
this perspective, but with an emphasis on Soviet security. After the
lack of international revolutionary success in the interwar years and
the searing experience of World War II, Stalin did not want to risk
unnecessary confrontations with the United States and Britain over
peripheral areas. In 1945, the Soviet leader still hoped that the Soviet
Union could reach what he saw as its limited aims in Europe without such
conflict. If so, there was no reason to exacerbate tension with his
allies over issues that were less important to Soviet foreign policy
overall.</p>
<p>But the postwar Soviet leadership also understood that the revolutionary
potential in Asia that had been kindled by Japan's collapse could not be
overlooked as an element in Soviet foreign affairs. Moscow's role, most
of them thought, was to channel this potential in the direction of
coalition governments that were anti-Japanese and---at the very
least---neutral in the worldwide, long-term conflict between capitalism
and socialism. The nascent Communist movements in Asia needed time to
build proper organizations, educate cadres, and learn from the USSR.
Moscow needed to set aside part of its own meager resources to assist
with these processes, many leading Communists argued. But it also needed
to spend more time studying the class composition and ideologies of the
nationalist and Left-wing parties in Asia in order to avoid making
mistakes. With his usual skepticism, Stalin was often on the side of
those who argued that the Soviets had to be careful with spending money
and materiel on untrustworthy groups and uncertain political prospects
in Asia, when so much else was at stake. Based on his reading of Soviet
(and Russian) history, the <em>vozhd</em>'s view was that there was only one
Asian country that really mattered to Moscow in the short run. That
country was Japan. And it was there, ironically, that the Soviets seemed
to have the least prospect for direct influence when the war ended.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-134}<strong>I[N]{.small-caps} A[UGUST
1945]{.small-caps}</strong> Japan was a country in ruins. Its wooden cities had
been burned to cinders by American firebombs. In Tokyo less than
one-third of the city remained standing, and even that was badly damaged
by bombs. Just one B-29 raid, in the night of 9 March 1945, set off a
firestorm that killed at least one hundred thousand people,
overwhelmingly civilians. The cities in the south, Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, had been attacked with nuclear weapons. One hundred twenty
thousand were killed instantly, and more died slow and agonizing deaths
from radiation. Everywhere infrastructure was in chaos, millions were
homeless or living as internal refugees. Then, as the empire collapsed,
almost three million Japanese refugees from abroad came to a home
country many of them had never seen and where there was little welcome
for them. If there was one thing Japan did not need in 1945 it was more
hungry mouths to feed. Food rations were already well below starvation
point, lower even than the terrible diet the Japanese had been offered
by their own government prior to the collapse.</p>
<p>The Japanese, understandably, blamed their own leaders as much as the
foreigners for the disasters that had befallen them. The common people
had been promised prosperity, land, and glory; what they got was death
and misery. The Japanese people had shown discipline, cohesion, and an
immense willingness to sacrifice for what they had been told was the
common good during the war. Now, in the fall of 1945, the wages for the
loyalty they had shown became clear. A country that had not seen a major
war for three hundred years lay devastated. No wonder there were huge
demonstrations outside the imperial palace in central Tokyo, with people
calling out to the emperor: "What will you have for dinner?" In May 1946
the so-called "Give Us Rice" mass meetings, organized by the leaders of
the Japanese Left---most of whom had just emerged from the previous
regime's prison camps---demanded "revolutionary changes" and "a
democratic
government."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en113en">^1^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en113}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-135}The Truman Administration was clear from
the outset that it did not want to share postwar control of Japan with
any other allied nation. The United States, the president believed, had
borne the brunt of the war against Japan and was the only country
capable of reforming it (the Chinese would be loath to agree). True, a
commission was set up, with pro forma participation by other allies,
including Australians and New Zealanders. But power was solely in the
hands of the Americans. General Douglas MacArthur, the old soldier who
had fought his way back into Asia at the end of the war---against both
the Japanese and the staff of the US Department of the Army---had been
named Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, and all authority in the
occupied country emanated from his office. MacArthur wanted to see Japan
transformed; he believed the country's wartime aggression stemmed from a
deep cultural propensity for violence, authoritarianism, and, as he
often put it, "ant-like behavior" that separated Japanese from Americans
(and from anyone else, for that matter). Japan's polity and economy had
to be completely rebuilt, so that barriers could be created for the
forms of behavior to which the Japanese were prone, and so that they
could be made into reliable allies of the United States in the global
conflict with Communism that the general was sure would come.</p>
<p>The radicalism of the reforms that the United States imposed on Japan is
often not understood today. The initial postsurrender directive issued
by President Truman in August 1945 called for the country to be
completely demilitarized, its territory limited to the home islands, and
its new constitution written by the occupiers. This constitution would
include "the freedoms of religion, assembly, speech, and the press....
The existing economic basis of Japanese military strength must be
destroyed.... [The United States would] favor a program for the
dissolution of the large industrial and banking combinations... [and
encourage] the development of organizations in labor, industry, and
agriculture, organized on a democratic
basis."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en114en">^2^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en114} MacArthur
may have been a very conservative US general, but his orders were to
carry out a revolution in Japan, with elements that smacked
distinctively of the New Deal policies of the FDR generation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-136}To the surprise of most Americans, the new
freedoms proposed for the Japanese were eagerly seized by the Japanese
themselves. As soon as they were allowed to do so, Japanese men and
women set up trade unions, self-help organizations, and political
groups. Schools and universities began to teach curriculums that
emphasized democracy and public participation, very different from the
wartime staple of nationalism and emperor-worship. Many saw Japan's old
elites as delegitimized by the support they had given to a disastrous
policy of expansion. They called themselves nationalists, but had
destroyed the nation, many believed. When Truman's advisers on Japan
insisted on keeping Emperor Hirohito in place, in spite of his obvious
responsibility for waging aggressive war, they claimed that removing him
would make the country ungovernable. But that view was more based on an
orientalist sense of Japanese devotion to absolute
authority---reinforced, of course, by the experience of fighting the
war---than on the rapid changes taking place in postwar Japanese
society.</p>
<p>By 1947, the impact of the Cold War had begun to change minds in
Washington about the best approach to Japan. The political Left in Japan
increased its support from 22 to more than 30 percent of the vote in the
April 1947 elections, and although less than 4 percent was for the
Communist Party, there was no doubt that political radicalism was
increasingly in vogue. Most Japanese believed that the main victors in
the war, the Americans and the Soviets, jointly stood for democracy; why
else, some Tokyo journalists noted, should the Americans introduce
reforms that opened opportunities for the Left? But General MacArthur
had already in 1946 issued a stern warning to the increasingly vocal
socialists: "If minor elements of Japanese society are unable to
exercise such restraint and self-respect as the situation and conditions
require, I shall be forced to take the necessary steps to control and
remedy such a deplorable
situation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en115en">^3^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en115}
George Kennan, visiting in 1948, was struck by how the lack of political
stability and economic development in Japan served as a drag on US
global policies. He called for a swift end to further reform and a
"relaxation" in the purge of wartime perpetrators. He also called for a
"limited re-militarization of Japan" if the Soviets were not
"extensively weakened and sobered" or "Japanese society still seems
excessively vulnerable in the political sense" by the time of a peace
treaty.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en116en">^4^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en116}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-137}The so-called "reverse course" by the
Americans gave Japanese conservatives back some of their
self-confidence. They could build on a Japanese society in which the
majority was becoming increasingly preoccupied with stemming economic
decline. The leaders of the Right seemed to have the better skills to
get factories going again, and to organize supplies of rice to the
cities. Those few on the Right who had fallen out with the wartime
militarists proved especially popular. Yoshida Shigeru, a former
diplomat who had been arrested for trying to force an early Japanese
surrender, became prime minister in 1946 and stayed on for most of the
time until 1954, though strongly challenged by the Left. From late 1948
thousands of Left-wing teachers, civil servants, and trade unionists
were thrown out of work in a reverse "Red purge." That their own people
were blacklisted when those who had been charged with war crimes now
walked free: this infuriated and radicalized the Japanese Left. In the
1949 elections the Communists got more than 10 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The occupation of Japan gave the United States a unique opportunity to
shape a former enemy into a long-term auxiliary. Both the period of
reform and the antiradical policies that followed were aimed at the same
purpose: to refashion Japan in the American image. It was, of course,
the US military victory in the Pacific War that made this possible. But
it was also dependent on shutting out the other victorious powers---and
chiefly the Soviet Union---from any real role in the occupation that
followed. Stalin was angry at the brazen exclusion of his country from
the occupation force, but he was not surprised. It was, after all, the
kind of behavior he himself had shown in eastern Europe. And he did not
expect Truman to do him any favors. Stalin's policy was to instruct the
Japanese Communist party to oppose the US occupation and to argue that
only a Japanese socialist revolution and an alliance with the Soviet
Union could resurrect Japanese independence. But he also held out a hand
to Japanese conservatives: if they wanted back the northern Kuril
Islands, which the USSR had occupied at the end of the war, and if they
wanted to trade with Communist China, then the road to such settlements
went through Moscow.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-138}The Communist victory in China and the
outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950 changed the strategic
situation in eastern Asia. Before, Japan had been an asset to the United
States primarily because of its long-term economic (and possibly
military) potential. After the North Korean attack, especially, Japan
was all the United States had in the region, and the country played a
key role in staging and supplying the US Army's counteroffensive in
Korea. The war made Washington decide to enter into a peace treaty with
Japan as soon as possible, so that the US got a permanent foothold in
Japan, and Japan assumed some of the responsibility for its own defense.
Truman insisted that the Japanese government first agree to a bilateral
security treaty with the United States, which committed Tokyo to have
the Americans as their only ally and gave Washington the right to bases
in Japan entirely outside the local government's purview. US forces,
said the treaty, would contribute to "the security of Japan against
armed attack from without, including assistance given at the express
request of the Japanese government to put down large-scale internal
riots and disturbances in
Japan."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en117en">^5^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en117} Yoshida
also had to declare that Japan would not enter into any agreements with
the Chinese Communist government. Only then could the peace treaty be
signed. The Soviets, predictably, refused to sign it, and China was not
even invited to the meeting.</p>
<p>Over time, Japan would develop into the most important US ally for
fighting the Cold War. Not only did it serve as an unsinkable aircraft
carrier off the coast of mainland Asia, but it was also in the late
1940s already central to US military planning, which assumed an offshore
strategy for US military predominance in the region. Later, the most
important part of the US-Japanese alliance was to become the economic
interaction and support Tokyo provided for US Cold War strategies. But
in the first years of the alliance, this was still in the future. As
Asia became an evermore important part of US foreign policy, the main
American concerns remained over the stability of the Japanese political
system and Tokyo's willingness to defend itself against Communism,
foreign or domestic.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-139}<strong>F[OR MOST]{.small-caps}
C[HINESE]{.small-caps}</strong> the twentieth century had been a topsy-turvy
experience. Their country had gone from being an empire in the early
century to becoming a republic, to becoming an anarchic collection of
competing regimes, to becoming a republic again. The latest incarnation
of the Chinese state, from the 1930s on, was a modernizing dictatorship
led by Chiang Kai-shek and his National People's Party, the Guomindang.
But the Japanese attack in 1937 had challenged Chiang's hold on power,
and allowed his domestic competitors to reemerge. While the Guomindang
was fighting for its life (and China's) against the Japanese onslaught,
these competitors had been gaining ground. First among them was the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which Chiang had been able to drive
almost out of existence by the mid-1930s. Without much direct contact
with Moscow, the CCP had been able to transform itself during the war
into a significant national party. Fighting the Japanese when it had to
and the Guomindang when an opportunity arose, the CCP in 1945 stood
ready to wrestle with Chiang's Nationalists for the leadership of China.</p>
<p>The war against Japan had offered the Chinese Communists their
opportunity to flourish. But it was their leader, Mao Zedong, who made
sure that they gripped that opportunity to gain power. Mao was a
brilliant, swashbuckling commander with a strong commitment to social
justice and a deep hatred for "old China" as he saw it---backwardness,
superstition, and patriarchy. He wanted to create a "new China," which
was modern and socially just at the same time. His main ideal was
Stalin's Soviet Union, a country he had never visited but which he
idolized as anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and progressive. By early
1945, Mao's forces were ready to link up with the Red Army in north
China, as part of a Soviet intervention that they expected to come soon,
and thereafter to challenge Chiang Kai-shek for supremacy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-140}But the end of the war in China came in
ways neither Mao nor his opponents had expected. Stalin hesitated in
attacking Japan for so long that Mao was close to despair. The CCP was
forced to begin contemplating a postwar China in which the United States
was the predominant foreign power, a scenario most definitely not to its
liking. Then, in August 1945, everything happened at once. Atomic bombs
fell on Japanese cities. The Soviet Union finally attacked Japan and
occupied northeast China, also known as Manchuria, and the northern part
of Korea. Japan capitulated. All of a sudden the power that had driven
China to the edge of extinction was no more. Mao ordered Chinese
Communist forces into Manchuria to grab as much territory from the
humbled Japanese as they could. His party seemed poised for major
successes.</p>
<p>Then everything went wrong for the Chinese Communists. The Americans
ordered the Japanese, who still held vast areas of China, to surrender
<em>only</em> to Chiang's forces. Using his status as the head of China's
internationally recognized government, Chiang negotiated a deal with
Stalin, in which the Guomindang was given control of Manchuria in return
for concessions to the Soviets for future economic and military
activities there. Even worse, the Chinese living along the eastern
seaboard---the most populous regions of the country, which had been
occupied by Japan during the war---welcomed Chiang's forces back as
liberating heroes when they arrived aboard American transport planes.
Mao seemed set to lose on most counts.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communists obviously would not take this lying down.
Ignoring Soviet orders, Communist soldiers made their way into Manchuria
anyway. As tension mounted in the fall of 1945, President Truman sent
America's number one wartime hero, General George C. Marshall, to
mediate in China. Stalin at first asked the CCP to cooperate with the
mediation, for two main reasons: the Soviet leader saw no chance for a
successful Communist revolution in China, and he needed Chiang's
continued cooperation in order to make use of the concessions he had
wrestled from China earlier in the year. Stalin's thinking was not so
much about sacrificing revolution in China for Soviet gain as it was
about getting some advantages for the Soviet Union (and therefore for
Communism) instead of getting no advantages. But the CCP would not
cooperate. As the party refused to give way to Chiang, military clashes
intensified. The Americans increasingly threw their weight behind the
Chinese president, who---emboldened---dragged his feet on implementing
China's agreement with the Soviets. With American pressure mounting, and
Cold War tensions erupting elsewhere, Stalin abruptly decided to
withdraw his forces from Manchuria in March 1946, probably knowing that
by doing so he threw the military advantage in the region to the Chinese
Communists. He may have thought that this would force Chiang back to the
negotiating table. Instead it set off a civil war that engulfed all of
China for the next four years.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-141}Chiang Kai-shek was hell-bent on
dislocating the CCP from Manchuria. His mission was to unite the country
under his leadership, and to resurrect it as a political and military
great power. In order to do so, he thought, the CCP had to be crushed.
His all-out US-assisted offensive against the Communists in late 1946
and 1947 came close to succeeding. But then he and his party
overreached. With increasing Soviet support, the Communist troops---now
reconstituted as the People's Liberation Army (PLA)---began attacking
Nationalist supply lines in Manchuria. While Chiang continued to pour
his best, US-equipped troops into the region, the military equation
there slowly changed. By late 1947 PLA marshal Lin Biao's troops began
an overall offensive. In early 1948 the Guomindang's main forces were
trapped in the northeast, to be picked off one by one by the PLA. The
war started to go badly for Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>While Chiang got into trouble on the battlefield, he also began
weakening his own position in the cities and in other areas controlled
by his government. Chiang was a man in a hurry. He wanted too much too
fast. First and foremost he wanted to build a strong central government,
which could guide and fund an economic and social revival for China.
Instead, his precipitous actions hurried the downfall of his regime. By
mid-1948 the peasantry deserted him because they resented seeing their
sons press-ganged into the army for a cause that seemed increasingly
hopeless. The landowners gave up on the Guomindang because Chiang seemed
intent on bringing his own men into their provinces to rule them. The
bourgeoisie turned against the government because it drove them into
penury through inflation and corruption. The working class in the
cities---among whom the Guomindang had some support and the CCP
none---was the last group to run away from the regime, but in 1949, when
the CCP armies overran all of China, few workers came forward to die for
the Nationalists.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-142}The Truman Administration---never keen on
Chiang's government to begin with, but much preferring it over the
Communists---also abandoned its wartime ally. Already in 1948 the
president's advisers made it clear that there was no way in which the
Nationalists could win, except through a direct US military
intervention. And under pressure elsewhere, especially in Europe, there
was no way the US president would sanction a landing of US troops to
fight in a civil war in mainland Asia, even if he believed such a war to
be winnable. George Marshall, now back in Washington as secretary of
state, had warned both Chinese and Americans that simply resupplying
Chiang's armies would not do the job. Chiang is faced "with a unique
problem of logistics," Marshall coldly told the Chinese ambassador
Wellington Koo. "He is losing about 40 percent of his supplies to the
enemy. If the percentage should reach 50, he will have to decide whether
it is wise to supply his own
troops."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en118en">^6^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en118}</p>
<p>While the Americans distanced themselves from Chiang, though never
cutting him off fully, the Soviets drew closer to the CCP. By early 1948
Soviet military aid was coming into Manchuria, and Red Army instructors
trained PLA officers both there and in the Soviet Union. It is likely
that the PLA would have won the civil war even without Red Army
assistance. But Soviet aid was politically important to the CCP. It
proved that the "great master" of Communism in Moscow, Joseph Stalin
himself, now accepted the party's policies, and that he would help a new
Chinese Communist state come into existence.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-143}While Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, the
island off China's coast that had been under Japanese direct rule since
the late nineteenth century, Mao in October 1949 set up a new government
in Beijing. In spite of Soviet appeals for caution, Mao declared it a
People's Republic, like the Soviet satellite states in eastern Europe.
He also insisted on setting out on a pilgrimage to Moscow right after
the new People's Republic of China (PRC) was declared, ostensibly to
help celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday. In reality, what Mao wanted
was an alliance with the USSR against US attempts at undermining his
revolution. The great master grudgingly permitted it. Stalin did not
trust the "class-basis" of the Chinese Communists. They were peasants,
he concluded, rather than workers. Theirs was a "national" rather than a
socialist revolution, and they should govern in alliance with the
national bourgeoisie, at least to begin with. Deeper down Stalin
distrusted the CCP for coming to power on its own rather than being
dependent on the Soviet Red Army. As he grew older, he increasingly
suspected anything and anyone he could not directly control. Mao got his
alliance but was not happy about being treated as a curiosity rather
than as the great master's foremost disciple, which he so much wanted to

<p>The new state the CCP set out to build was formed in the Soviet image.
The party pretended that their government was a coalition, mainly to
please Stalin and the Soviet advisers. But its new constitution
highlighted the leading role of the CCP and lauded the "indestructible
friendship with the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." In
reality there was no doubt: the CCP ruled China, and it set out to purge
those who might disagree with its way forward. "We stand for the
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry under the leadership of
the Communist Party, for a people's dictatorship, because workers and
peasants make up 90% of China's population," Mao told the Soviets. "Such
a regime will provide democracy for the people and dictatorship for the
landlords, bureaucratic capital, and imperialists. We call our regime a
new democracy, based on the union of workers and peasants under the
leadership of the proletariat, represented by its vanguard, the
Communist Party."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en119en">^7^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en119}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-144}The revolutionary violence that the new
regime unleashed on China had three main purposes. Mao wanted to break
the power of the traditional elite in the countryside and the
bourgeoisie in the cities. He wanted to insulate China from
non-Communist foreign influence by driving out foreigners and banning
their newspapers, books, and films. And he wanted to mobilize China's
youth, through mass campaigns, to build a new socialist republic
patterned on the Soviet Union. The outbreak of the Korean War in the
summer of 1950 may have made these purges bloodier than they otherwise
might have become. But all the key elements were there from the
beginning, borrowed straight from Stalin's campaigns of the 1930s in the
Soviet Union, not least the province-wide quotas of how many
counterrevolutionaries had to be found and eliminated. Almost two
million people were killed in the first two years of CCP rule, even as
the Soviet advisers warned against
rashness.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en120en">^8^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en120}</p>
<p>In spite of the brutal and often meaningless crimes of the new regime,
Chinese did flock to its banner in large numbers. Many believed Mao's
version, that after hundred years of weakness, the Chinese people had
finally stood up. Nationalism was the order of the day, and so many
Chinese desperately wanted a country they could be proud of. If
Communism was the wave of the future, then China would have to accept
it, or even be at the forefront of it, they thought. Fighting the war in
Korea against the United States helped fuel Chinese nationalism. But
Mao's project, and the stories he told about how all of China's past
pointed toward this moment of Communist victory, also had a more
profound appeal. It fitted with the image of collective action and
collective justice that leaders had been fond of promulgating for much
of Chinese history. To some, who felt that they had let their country
down through wars and confrontations in the first half of the twentieth
century, the Communist revolution was a kind of cleansing: it might have
used methods that were incomprehensible or even inhuman, but the
revolution gave them the opportunity to immerse themselves in something
bigger than the individual, something meaningful, something that would,
eventually, set China right.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-145}The power of the Chinese revolution was
felt far outside the borders of China itself. In southeast Asia,
anticolonial revolutionary parties were encouraged and emboldened. In
Korea, Kim Il-sung's Communists felt that they, too, could now reunify
their country by force. Even in Japan, where elites had regarded Chinese
Communism as a deadly threat, nationalists secretly rejoiced at seeing
Asians taking power by themselves, in spite of US opposition. Among
Chinese diasporas, many who had had little affinity with Communism
celebrated the advent of a strong government in
China.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en121en">^9^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en121} In India
and in Europe, the Chinese revolution was seen as a major shift in world
politics. The nationalist prime minister of newly independent India,
Jawaharlal Nehru, told his parliament that "it was a basic revolution
involving millions and millions of human beings..., [which] produced a
perfectly stable government, strongly entrenched and
popular."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en122en">^10^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en122} French
newspaper editorials---across the political spectrum---commented on the
swiftness of the transition and how it strengthened Communism as an
ideology everywhere. In <em>Le Figaro</em>, the French anti-Communist
intellectual Raymond Aron observed, with much portent, that "the
conquest of the former Chinese Empire by a revolutionary party
professing an ideology of Western origin, which has now become the
official religion of a Eurasian empire, constitutes a historic event,
paradoxical at first sight and still unpredictable in its
consequences.... The example of China, after that of Russia, shows that
Marxism, created by Marx for post-capitalist societies, has a better
chance of success in pre-capitalist
societies."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en123en">^11^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en123}</p>
<p>In the United States the overall reaction was more one of profound
shock. Since the early part of the twentieth century, the few Americans
who were preoccupied with such matters had seen their country as a
benevolent guide for China, helping and assisting the country as it
entered the world stage. This view had reached its zenith during World
War II when the United States and China had been allies, fighting the
Japanese together, in order---interested Americans thought---to free
China and enable it to join the United States as a obliging world power.
Franklin Roosevelt had often spoken of China as one of the future "world
policemen," around which the United Nations system should be based. Now
US dreams and investments seemed to be in tatters. But instead of
blaming their own foreign policy, many US officials found that the
Chinese were to blame. They were seen as ungrateful and devious,
spurning generations of US assistance for them.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-146}The Cold War implications of the Communist
takeover in China were immediately visible to the Truman Administration.
China had joined the Soviet Union in an alliance directed against the
United States. While there were some who believed nationalist pressures
eventually would drive the alliance apart, the majority view was one of
alarm, dismay, and betrayal. The Korean War of course intensified the
loathing of the Chinese Communists; Truman noted in 1951 that "as long
as I am president, if I can prevent it, that cut-throat organization
will never be recognized by us as the government of
China."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en124en">^12^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en124} But even
before the outbreak of war in Korea, NSC-68 had warned that "the
Communist success in China, taken with the politico-economic situation
in the rest of South and South-East Asia, provides a springboard for a
further incursion in this troubled
area."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en125en">^13^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en125}</p>
<p>The alarmism of the Truman Administration was not enough for the
president's critics. By the late 1940s, most Republicans had shed their
isolationist image and become ardent Cold Warriors, accusing Truman of
being soft on Communism abroad and at home. The US "loss of China"
provided them with ammunition. As Truman sought Congressional funding
for his Cold War doctrine in Europe, first-term Republican congressman
Richard Nixon made the case for a global Communist threat, which he
believed the Democratic Administration had ignored: "What is the
difference between the spread of Communism in China and Red influences
in the eastern Mediterranean?... [Are we] going to make the same
mistake as we did in China by sending pinks and fellow-travellers to
fight Communism and sabotage our announced program? And, if we are going
to combat Communism in Greece and Turkey, should we not also clean house
here at home and remove Communists and fellow-travellers from positions
of power in our governmental departments and labor
unions?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en126en">^14^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en126} Linking
up with Joe McCarthy, whom he joined in the US Senate in 1950, Nixon
charged the Democrats with the United States losing China to the
Communists.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en127en">^15^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en127}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-147}<strong>A[S NORTHEAST]{.small-caps}
A[SIA]{.small-caps}</strong> was being transformed through war, occupation, and
revolution, southeast Asia was going through its own transfiguration.
Unlike the region to its north, almost all of southeast Asia had been
colonized by outside powers during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. Indochina had come under French control, while most of the
southern archipelago had been taken over by the Dutch. The British ruled
Malaya and Burma. The Americans---latecomer imperialists---had taken
possession of the Philippines. Only Thailand remained precariously
independent. But in the first few years after 1945 this established
order was turned upside down. The veteran Communist Ho Chi Minh declared
Vietnam's independence in August 1945. The same month, the radical
nationalist Sukarno proclaimed the new sovereign state of Indonesia,
covering all the territory the Dutch had colonized. In Burma, Aung San
negotiated a British withdrawal in January 1947. Both Sukarno and Aung
San had collaborated with the Japanese. Aung San, a former Communist and
leader of an intensely nationalist group, had set up the Burma National
Army in Japan, and only switched sides in March 1945, when he
constructed the abundantly named Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League,
together with the Burmese Communist Party. Sukarno had launched his five
principles for the new Indonesian state---nationhood, internationalism,
democracy, socialism, and faith---in Japanese-occupied Jakarta, and
worked with the Japanese until they capitulated. He then set about
constructing a new country, irrespective of Dutch designs on returning
to their colony after the collapse of Japan.</p>
<p>But there was to be no easy way to independence and nationhood, as the
Indonesian example shows. After the Japanese surrender, British forces
occupied the main Indonesian cities. London decided to let the Dutch
take back their former colony. Indonesian resistance grew, culminating
in the battle of Surabaya in November 1945. Six hundred British
soldiers, including their commander, Brigadier Aubertin Mallaby, died
for the Dutch right to return. More than nine thousand Indonesians were
killed. Surabaya was a reminder both to the British and the Americans of
the strength of southeast Asian nationalism, and they urged the
Netherlands to settle for a loose affiliation with Indonesia. When the
Dutch in 1947 attempted to overthrow the young republic by force, the
British refused to support them, and the Americans were caught in a
quandary. They were afraid that forcing a Dutch withdrawal from
southeast Asia would weaken the government in the Netherlands itself and
provoke social and economic instability there. But they were even more
worried that the longer the Dutch "police operation" in its former
colony went on, the more would nationalists such as Sukarno have to give
way to the policies of the powerful Indonesian Communist Party. In the
end, the Indonesian Communists solved the US policy dilemma by launching
an ill-fated armed uprising against the leaders of the Indonesian
republic. When the Dutch tried to make use of the chaos on the
Indonesian side to reinforce its intervention and arrest some of the
Indonesian leaders, the Truman Administration put its foot down. While
threatening to cut off economic aid to the Netherlands, Washington
supported a UN Security Council resolution demanding that the Indonesian
republic's leadership be reinstated. The Dutch agreed to give Indonesia
independence by the end of the year.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-148}The saga of Indonesian sovereignty shows
two important links from the Cold War to a rapidly decolonizing world.
The first is that in most places outside of China and its immediate
neighbors, Communist parties were no match for more popular and
better-organized nationalists. And China itself may have been an
exception simply because the Japanese had already done so much damage to
the Communists' enemies, the Guomindang under Chiang Kai-shek. The
second is that the United States, generally, was more preoccupied with
preventing Communist gains than with supporting its western European
allies in retaking their former colonies. When a US Administration
became convinced that the latter stood in the way of the former, it
would act even against its own allies. The problem, as the Cold War
progressed, was that in ideological terms it became harder and harder
for US political leaders to distinguish between radical nationalism and
Communism. Both were seen as anti-American, and the policies of radical
nationalists were believed to pave the way for the Communists (in spite
of much evidence to the contrary).</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-149}Vietnam was, with the possible exception
of Korea, the only former Asian colony where Communism was the choice of
the predominant pro-independence leaders. One reason, ironically, was
the integration of Vietnamese elites into French culture and education,
from whence the post-1914 generation took over the radicalization that
was prevalent among French youth, too. The internationalism of Soviet
Communism appealed to many in the Vietnamese independence movement. It
gave them a chance to show why and how their struggle for self-rule was
of global importance, on par with what was happening in France itself.
Ho Chi Minh, the key leader connecting Vietnam to the Cold War, also
symbolized this link between Vietnamese nationalism and Communist
internationalism. Ho was born in 1890 and attended a French lycée in
Hue. Fascinated by the world outside of Vietnam, Ho traveled to France,
Britain, and the United States, where he worked in menial jobs---among
them as a waiter at the Carlton Hotel in London---and studied in his
free time. Having campaigned unsuccessfully for Vietnam's independence
at the Versailles conferences after World War I, he became a founding
member of the French Communist Party and went on to work for the
Communist International, the Comintern, in Moscow and then in China and
southeast Asia from 1923 to 1941. Only then did he return to Vietnam,
where he sensed that France's defeat in World War II provided an
opportunity to break his country free from colonial rule. Ho and the
organization he headed, the Viet Minh, short for the League for the
Independence of Vietnam, fought the Vichy French and the Japanese, never
trusting Tokyo's promises of postwar independence for Vietnam and
following instructions from Moscow to put pressure on the Japanese
Imperial Army.</p>
<p>When the Japanese suddenly capitulated in August 1945, Ho, like Sukarno,
immediately struck for Vietnamese independence. In an attempt to build
on wartime Great Power cooperation and avoid US support for his enemies,
Ho put his declaration into an international perspective: "'All men are
created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness.' This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of
Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader
sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth,
all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free." Like Mao in
China, Ho believed that the Communist revolution in Vietnam, which would
follow the Viet Minh's taking of power under Communist leadership, could
only be prevented by US intervention against them. Ho may have thought
about parallels from the French history he had studied. If Paris was
well worth a mass for the Protestant king Henry IV, then the Vietnamese
revolution could well be worth a quotation from the Declaration of
Independence by the Communist Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-150}If it had not been for the French
determination to return to Vietnam after the war, Ho may well have been
right. One key reason why the United States did get involved in matters
in Vietnam (and the rest of Indochina) was that the French forces
continued to fight Ho's Viet Minh until the Korean War broke out. At
first, Washington took a dim view of the French recolonization of
Indochina, even though successive French governments were hard at work
trying to convince Truman that the fighting there was a conflict between
Communism and "the Free World." But with the war in Korea raging, and
with Chinese Communist support for the Viet Minh becoming increasingly
evident, neither Truman nor Eisenhower who succeeded him felt that
handing Vietnam over to Ho Chi Minh was a defensible proposition. The
problem was that the battles in the north of Vietnam were increasingly
going against the French, and in May 1954 they suffered a massive defeat
at Dien Bien Phu, attacked jointly by Viet Minh fighters and Chinese
heavy artillery.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en128en">^16^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en128}</p>
<p>For the new Eisenhower Administration, Dien Bien Phu was a massive
problem in Cold War terms. The United States had supported France both
directly and indirectly during the outdrawn battle. It had supplied
weapons and aircraft to the French, and toward the end, two US Air Force
squadrons of B-26 bombers had attacked Vietnamese targets around the
battle area. Still, the French had lost, the government in Paris had
collapsed as a result, and Pierre Mendès-France, the new Left-leaning
French premier, wanted to withdraw from Indochina as soon as possible.
Eisenhower refused to put US soldiers on the ground. "Any nation that
intervenes in a civil war can scarcely expect to win unless the side in
whose favor it intervenes possesses a high morale based upon a war
purpose or cause in which it believes," the president said. In private,
he criticized the French, accusing them of having used "weasel words in
promising independence and through this one reason as much as anything
else, have suffered reverses that have been really
inexcusable."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en129en">^17^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en129}
But he also warned against letting the Communists come to power in
Vietnam. "You have the specific value of a locality in its production of
materials that the world needs," Eisenhower told reporters as the 1954
international conference on Indochina was gathering. "Then you have the
possibility that many human beings pass under a dictatorship that is
inimical to the free world. Finally, you have broader considerations
that might follow what you would call the 'falling domino' principle.
You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and
what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over
very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that
would have the most profound
influences."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en130en">^18^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en130}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-151}Another possible domino that both Truman
and Eisenhower worried about was India. Washington had generally
applauded British prime minister Attlee's decision---imposed on him by a
deteriorating economy at home and expanding protests against British
rule---to grant India early independence after World War II. Far better,
Truman thought, to hand over to Indian nationalists than wait for
conditions favoring the Communists to grow. But the Americans were also,
from the beginning of independence in 1947, skeptical of the political
orientation of some of India's leaders, and especially of the
predominant party, the Indian National Congress. "He just doesn't like
white men," Truman complained after having met Nehru the first
time.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en131en">^19^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en131}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-152}For Nehru, his US problem was far bigger
than the Americans' India problem. The Indian National Congress, which
he represented, was an anticolonial movement, founded in 1885, which
aimed at Indian independence, anti-imperialism, and Asian solidarity.
Its thinking about social and economic development was distinctly
socialist; Congress believed in centralized planning and a state-led
economy, and its main political aim was to abolish India's terrifying
rural poverty. Nehru himself combined the feeling of superiority a
Cambridge education had left in him with a deep sense of social justice
and national purpose. He also believed firmly that Asian leaders had to
stand together to abolish colonialism and take responsibility for global
affairs. Although never attracted by Communism as an ideology, Nehru and
many of his colleagues had a long-standing fascination with Soviet
development models, which they regarded as more appropriate for India
than any form of capitalism. From the very beginning of his tenure as
prime minister, Nehru viewed the United States as an impatient and
immature Superpower with a missionary zeal, and as a potential
troublemaker for postcolonial Asia.</p>
<p>Nehru's view of a benign India ready to take its position on the world
stage had been severely dented by the violence surrounding his country's
independence from Britain. As it became clear that parts of India's
Muslim minority would break away and form their own state, Pakistan, on
the country's western and eastern borders, masses of refugees started to
move in either direction. Seventeen million were displaced and at least
half a million died as a result of interethnic violence. In Punjab,
especially, defenseless refugees---Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs---were
attacked by mobs from outside their own religious communities. Rape was
common. The relationship between India and Pakistan was poisoned as a
result, and the other countries that came out of British decolonization
in south Asia---Burma, Nepal, Bhutan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)---all
looked with suspicion at the behavior of their big neighbor India.
Nehru's Congress government was born into a difficult foreign policy
region.</p>
<p>Eisenhower worried about India's allegiance in Cold War terms, though he
was wary of spending too much on foreign aid to that country. The State
Department appealed for increased funding for India. "There is no time
to lose," said the department's Office of South Asian Affairs in 1952.
"Communist gains in the recent elections in India show clearly that the
conditions our program is designed to combat are being successfully
exploited by Communist agents.... [i]f South Asia is subverted it will
be only a matter of time before all of the Asian land-mass and over a
billion people will be under Communist domination, and our national
security will face an unprecedented
threat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en132en">^20^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en132} US aid
to India (and to its neighbors) did gradually increase. But the
political relationship between the two giant countries---both democratic
heirs to a British political culture---showed few signs of improving.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-153}Further west in Asia, matters were
threatening to develop in an even more negative direction for the United
States. Since World War II Washington had been preoccupied with securing
oil supplies from the Middle East to its allies in Europe and east Asia.
French and British decolonization in the region threatened to create the
kind of political instability that could upset such supplies, which the
Cold War had made even more significant. Still, the Truman
Administration was hopeful that power could be handed over to moderate
nationalists, mostly from the local royal families, who could be
depended upon to fight Communism and continue to work with foreign oil
companies to deliver oil. Saudi Arabia promised such cooperation, as did
Iraq, both led by conservative monarchs. But although both Syria and
Egypt seemed to be moving in a pro-western direction, the conflict in
Palestine threatened to undo US aims in the Middle East. Like Muslims in
Pakistan had done the year before, Jews in Palestine in 1948 declared
their own state, after a vote in the UN General Assembly recommended the
partition of the territory, which both the United States and the USSR
had voted in favor of. Truman argued, against most of his foreign policy
advisers, that early recognition of Israel was necessary both for Cold
War and domestic political reasons. The president's preference had been
for a federated or binational Palestine. In a diatribe in his personal
diary, he wrote, "The Jews, I find are very, very selfish. They care not
how many... get murdered or mistreated, as long as the Jews get special
treatment. Yet when they have power, physical, financial or political
neither Hitler nor Stalin has anything on them for cruelty or
mistreatment to the
underdog."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en133en">^21^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en133} But
in spite of his anti-Semitic attitudes, he worried that not recognizing
Israel would open it up for Soviet influence and cost him votes in the
presidential election in the fall.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-154}As soon as Israel was declared in May 1948
the country was attacked by armies from the Arab states. The civil war
in Palestine became an international war, which Israel won. It took
control of much of the territory that according to the partition plan
should have gone to Palestinian Arabs, while Jordan and Egypt took over
the Palestinian West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian civil war
thereby became a permanent affliction in international affairs, which
would have a major influence on the Cold War. It also soon brought the
Cold War directly into the Middle East, as both Israelis and Arabs were
looking for allies in their conflict with each other. Of course, the
Cold War in the Middle East was about more than the Palestinian issue.
But the permanence of that conflict did make it an unavoidable aspect of
all foreign involvement in the region.</p>
<p>In 1945, though, the biggest concern in the Muslim world for both
Superpowers was Iran. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in
1941, the Soviets and the British had occupied Iran in order to prevent
any possible cooperation between Germany and Iranian nationalists. A
major aim was to keep control of the Iranian oil production, through the
monopoly of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC; later British
Petroleum, or BP). The occupation further alienated the majority of
Iranians, and gave the Soviets the opportunity to support Azeri and
Kurdish separatist movements in their northern occupation zone against
the central government in Tehran. Having secured agreement for the
continuation of the AIOC monopoly, the British withdrew their forces by
early spring 1946. But, much like he did in China, Stalin decided to
hold out for a better deal with the Iranians. Meanwhile, Azeris and
Kurds declared their own autonomous republics in northern Iran, with
Soviet support.</p>
<p>US and British attempts at forcing the USSR to withdraw from Iran in the
spring of 1946 constituted one of the first Cold War crises. "Tell
Stalin that I had always held him to be a man to keep his word. Troops
in Iran after Mar[ch] 2 upset that theory," Truman instructed his
Soviet ambassador when the Red Army had not withdrawn by the UN
deadline. The ambassador delivered the warning, adding that "it would be
misinterpreting the character of the United States to assume that
because we are basically peaceful and deeply interested in world
security, we are either divided, weak or unwilling to face our
responsibilities. If the people of the United States were ever to become
convinced that we are faced with a wave of progressive aggression on the
part of any powerful nation or group of nations, we would react exactly
as we have in the
past."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en134en">^22^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en134} Stalin
was furious. When the Iranian prime minister, the nationalist Ahmad
Qavam, held out against Soviet demands for economic agreements, the
Soviet leader ordered his diplomats "to wrench concessions from Qavam,
to give him support, to isolate the Anglophiles, thus, and to create
some basis for the further democratization of
Iran."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en135en">^23^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en135} Stalin's
contradictory orders did little good for Soviet diplomacy. When the Red
Army did withdraw, under US pressure, in May 1946, Qavam lost no time in
breaking every promise he had given to the Soviets. In December 1946
Iranian troops took control of the north, and the Azeri and Kurdish
leaders who did not escape to the Soviet Union were publicly executed.
The Iranian Communist Party, the Tudeh---the biggest Communist group in
the Middle East---suffered a setback from which it was hard to recover.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-155}<strong>I[N]{.small-caps} I[RAN,
AS]{.small-caps}</strong> elsewhere in Asia, Soviet policy was riddled with
contradictions. Stalin wanted to support the Communist parties, but did
not in a single case believe that they were ready to carry out
revolutions on their own. When he was proven wrong, as in China, he
spent more time worrying about the "real"---meaning potentially
discordant---content of these massive political transformations than
designing plans for their further development. But he also wanted to
exploit Soviet power to get material advantages from Asian states. In
part because he suspected their revolutions were bourgeois nationalist,
rather than socialist, he pushed so hard for such concessions that he
put the local Communists on the defensive. It was not easy to explain to
the population in Iran that the Communists were against all foreign oil
concessions, except the Soviet ones. Or for Mao Zedong to explain to the
Chinese that the Soviet comrades wanted to keep special privileges for
themselves in China's northern provinces.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-156}In some cases the Soviet Union seemed more
preoccupied with acting as a spoiler to US or British interests than
developing a long-term policy of its own. The recognition of Israel is a
case in point. In spite of his own deep-seated and escalating
anti-Semitism, Stalin believed that it was more important to create
difficulties for Britain's position in the Middle East than to stick
with the earlier Soviet policy of creating a secular unified state in
Palestine. In his instructions, the Soviet UN ambassador Andrei
Vyshinskii---who may have wondered what was going on in Moscow---was
told not to be "alarmed by a large minority of Arabs in the Jewish
state, provided that it is less than 50 percent. This situation will not
threaten the existence of an independent Jewish state, since the Jewish
element in the state will inevitably
increase."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en136en">^24^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en136}
Stalin's views on the Cold War played a key role in the creation of the
state of Israel, in ways that the Soviets would soon regret.</p>
<p>Still, what mattered more in Asia was the Soviet model for development,
rather than Stalin's foreign policy initiatives. From China to Israel,
ruling parties were influenced by what they saw as Soviet achievements
with regard to economic and social progress. State planning, national
industries, and collective agriculture played a key role in government
programs all over Asia. As we have seen, such policies were not foreign
to western European governments either, at least not during the initial
phase of postwar reconstruction. But in the new, postcolonial Asia the
inspiration was more often taken directly from the Soviet experience.
While deploring its lack of freedom, Nehru praised the Soviet Union for
having "advanced human society by a great leap," citing its achievements
"in education and culture and medical care and physical fitness and in
the solution of the problem of nationalities---by the amazing and
prodigious effort to create a new world out of the dregs of the
old."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en137en">^25^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en137} Nehru
quoted the Indian poet and Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore, who
in his deathbed message lauded "the unsparing energy with which Russia
has tried to fight disease and illiteracy, and has succeeded in steadily
liquidating ignorance and poverty, wiping off the humiliation from the
face of a vast continent. Her civilization is free from all invidious
distinction between one class and another, between one sect and another.
The rapid and astounding progress achieved by her made me happy and
jealous at the same
time."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en138en">^26^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en138}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-157}<strong>T[HE]{.small-caps} U[NITED]{.small-caps}
S[TATES]{.small-caps}</strong> was as hesitant as the Soviet Union when
approaching the new Asia, but even more bound by links to the European
colonial past. Ironically, for a country that often highlighted its own
anticolonial heritage, postwar US Administrations mostly failed to
prioritize anticolonialism over Cold War concerns. And even when it did
push European powers toward decolonization, as with the Netherlands in
the case of Indonesia, it was mainly because the assumed Cold War
consequences of not doing so were greater than their opposite. This
failure of imagination had many reasons. The sense of a racial
hierarchy, in which Europeans were at the top, influenced US
policy-making. Concepts of religion likewise: those who believed in
Christianity, both in Europe as well as Asian converts, ought to be
defended against those who did not. And economic interest played a role,
though increasingly as a systemic concern. Washington wanted to promote
access to raw materials and future markets for the United States and its
allies. In Asia as in Europe, US policy in the early Cold War was more
oriented toward the expansion of capitalism as such than toward a unique
preservation of US national economic advantage or the interests of
specific US companies.</p>
<p>By the end of the Chinese civil war, if not before, both the US
government and its critics at home subsumed all other concerns in Asia
to the exigencies of the Cold War. The future in Asia did not look
bright to most American leaders. Before the Korean War and well before
his campaign for the presidency, General Eisenhower had noted to himself
that "Asia is lost with Japan, P[hilippine] I[slands],
N[etherlands] E[ast] I[ndies] and even Australia under threat.
India itself is not
safe!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en139en">^27^</a>{#chapter005.xhtml#en139}
[]{#chapter005.xhtml#page-158}The fear of the consequences of a Viet
Minh victory in Vietnam came out of such apocalyptic Cold War concerns.
So did the decision to intervene in Korea, though Korea also gave the
Americans a chance to strike back against what they saw as a pattern of
Soviet aggression everywhere. The Korean War combined Superpower
confrontation with Asian nationalism. It was an Asian civil war, but
also the biggest campaign of the Cold War.

<p>The war in Korea and its effects were perhaps the biggest calamities of
the Cold War. They devastated a country and enchained a people. Their
direct consequences are with us today and will last long into the
future. And, worst of all, this was an entirely avoidable war, created
by the intensity of ideological conflict among Koreans and a Cold War
framework that enabled Superpower interventions. The Korean War
symbolized the Cold War conflict at its most frightening. Extreme,
barbaric, and seemingly inexhaustible, it reduced Korea to a wasteland
and made people all over the world wonder if their country might be next
for such a disaster. It therefore intensified and militarized the Cold
War on a global scale.</p>
<p>The origins of the Korean War linked the late nineteenth century
collapse of Chinese power in east Asia with the rise of Cold War
ideological conflict. The fall of the Qing Empire, with which Korea had
long been associated, opened the way for Japanese imperialist expansion
across the region. The first country to be taken over was Korea, after
China lost the 1894--95 war against Japan. By 1910 Korea was fully
annexed to Japan, as an integral part of its empire. The Japanese
administration did its best to stamp out Korean identity. The royal
palace in Seoul was demolished and Japanese became the medium of
instruction for all higher education. Tokyo even tried to force Koreans
to wear Japanese dress and assimilate in social codes and family life.
But at the same time, just like in the European empires that the
Japanese admired and feared in equal amounts, there was widespread
segregation of colonizers and colonized. Most Koreans understood that
they could never become full members of the Japanese Empire, even if
they had wanted to.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-160}From the beginning, the occupation of
Korea gave rise to nationalist resistance. For many young Koreans, the
real insult of the Japanese takeover was that it came just as they were
formulating their own views of their country's future. Some of them went
into exile, and the nationalisms they conceived there were intense and
uncompromising, as ideal views of one's own country formed abroad often
are. Korean nationalists wedded themselves not only to defeating Japan
and liberating their country but also to building a future, unified
Korea that was modern, centralized, powerful, and virtuous. Korea, they
believed, could not only produce its own liberation but would stand as
an example for other downtrodden peoples.</p>
<p>Throughout World War I and its aftermath, Korean nationalists argued
that the principles of national self-determination should also extend to
Asians. But with Japan being on the winning side in the war, their calls
stood little chance of being accepted. The exiled Korean nationalists
who traveled to Paris for the 1919 Peace Conference were bitterly
disappointed. Not only did they fail to get foreign recognition, but
Japan seemed to have the support of the United States and Britain for
its Korean policies. With Japan joining in the attempts at isolating the
new Soviet state, neither Washington nor London wanted to risk a
falling-out with Tokyo over Korea. In Korea the disappointment led to
rebellion, which was put down by the Japanese with great loss of Korean
life.</p>
<p>One of the Korean nationalists who was shattered by the failed campaign
for Korean nationhood in Paris was Syngman Rhee. Born in 1875, Rhee had
spent six years in prison for nationalist activities. He then moved to
the United States, where he was the first Korean to get a US PhD (from
Princeton in 1910). Rhee was a tireless editor and publisher of
nationalist texts during his long exile in the United States. At the
core of all of them was the need to get US support for the just Korean
cause. Appealing to Woodrow Wilson in 1919, Rhee had called out: "You
have already championed the cause of the oppressed and held out your
helping hand to the weak of the earth's races. Your nation is the Hope
of Mankind, so we come to
you."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en140en">^1^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en140} Twenty
years later Rhee had still not given up hope of US support. Right before
Pearl Harbor he published a book predicting that Japan would attack the
United States and that the best hope for a US victory would be an
alliance with nationalists on the Asian mainland, including
(prominently) in Korea.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-161}Rhee envisioned Korea as a modern country
that embraced its Confucian past. The president of the Republic of Korea
in exile, as he now styled himself, wanted a Korea invigorated by US
technology and management methods, but within the constraints of
traditional virtues. As much as he hated the Japanese, he despised
Korean radicals who wanted a socialist country after liberation. They
were nothing but stooges of the Russians, Rhee thought. Just like some
Koreans had joined up with the Japanese, others had ended up in bed with
the Soviets. To Rhee they were defectors who had to return to true
Korean nationalism, which---with US assistance---would build a new
nation under his leadership.</p>
<p>To Rhee's increasing desperation, his campaigns in the United States
during World War II did not make much more progress than those during
the war twenty years before. The Americans concentrated on the war
effort and on the alliance with China, with little time for Rhee and his
associates, who did not seem able to deliver anything of vital interest
for winning the war. The State Department considered Rhee a nuisance.
But he kept in touch with US intelligence, which believed that Rhee's
anti-Communism might make him useful as soon as the war was over. By
1945, Rhee's attention had already shifted from the Japanese to the
Soviets. "The only possibility," he told his US friends, "of avoiding
the ultimate conflict between the United States and the Soviet Republics
is to build up all the democratic, not communistic, elements wherever
possible now."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en141en">^2^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en141}</p>
<p>Syngman Rhee was right about who his competitors for allegiance in
postwar Korea would be. Ever since 1919, Korean Communism had developed,
against the odds, as the alternative to the Korean nationalism that Rhee
represented. Like elsewhere in Asia, the Russian Revolution had been an
inspiration for many Koreans, with its promise of modernity, equality,
and respect for national rights. The first Communist groups were set up
among Koreans in Siberia in 1918, and by the early 1920s the movement
had spread to Korea itself as part of the underground resistance. A
Korean Communist Party was organized in Seoul in 1925 but quickly became
a focus-point for the Japanese police, and hundreds of party activists
were arrested. The repression led to increased factional infighting,
which, in the late 1920s and '30s, got entangled in Stalin's murderous
purges in the Soviet Union. Korean Communism was to have no easy future.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-162}A Korean Comintern agent, sent
clandestinely to Korea to report on the situation there in the late
1920s, found large numbers of youth ready to join the Communists. "They
regard the USSR and Comintern as their saviors from Japanese
imperialism," he reported. Unfortunately they had "only superficial
familiarity with Marxism," being mainly "former students and
intellectuals who came from the ranks of the bourgeois independence
movement." Their activities suffered from "theoretical chaos and long
term mostly unprincipled factional
strife."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en142en">^3^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en142} In 1928
the Comintern closed down the Korean Communist Party, believing it was
better to educate Korean cadres in Moscow and send them back later to
set up a proper Communist movement. But during the purges of the late
1930s all top Korean Communists in Moscow were arrested and shot,
accused of being Japanese spies. In 1937 almost two hundred thousand
Soviet Koreans living in the USSR's Pacific regions were forcibly
deported to central Asia. Stalin's fear of a fifth column in Soviet Asia
was more important than his dedication to revolution in Korea.</p>
<p>Among the Korean Communists who survived the double whammy of Japanese
and Stalinist oppression was a small number that had joined the Chinese
Communist underground in neighboring Manchuria. One of them was Kim
Il-sung, a young Korean from a Presbyterian family who had settled in
Manchuria in 1920, when Kim was eight years old. Kim joined his first
Marxist group at seventeen, and was jailed several times for his
activities. At nineteen, he became a member of the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) and soon after was fighting against the Japanese with a
small band of guerillas. Five years later he was already a bit of a
mythical hero among Koreans in China, largely because the guerrilla
group he now commanded had been able to survive Japanese operations
against it. But slowly the Japanese were catching up, and in 1940 Kim
and his surviving comrades slipped across the border to the Soviet
Union. When Germany attacked there the following year, Kim volunteered
for the Red Army. He returned to Korea in 1945 as a Soviet officer,
proudly displaying the Order of the Red Banner, usually given for
extraordinary heroism in combat.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-163}The Korea to which Kim returned was a
country in flux. At the Cairo Conference two years earlier the Allied
powers had jointly agreed to restore Korean independence after the war
was over. When the USSR attacked Japan, at the last minute, Washington
and Moscow had agreed to zones of occupation on the peninsula, divided
by the thirty-eighth parallel: the Soviets to the north and the
Americans to the south. The dividing line was simply supposed to be a
wartime arrangement to facilitate the Japanese capitulation. Nobody in
1945 believed that the division would be permanent, least of all the
Koreans themselves.</p>
<p>In both zones the liberators turned to people known to them to help
organize administration and supplies. Even though the Americans often
found him unreliable and irksome, Syngman Rhee was a choice that was
hard to avoid in the US zone. He had plenty of nationalist legitimacy
and an organization that could operate on the ground. Rhee did become
the central political figure in the south with US aid, but even so,
political clashes with his American sponsors intensified. Rhee wanted
international recognition for his government, based on a movement he
called the National Society for the Rapid Realization of Korean
Independence. Washington was still hoping, at least up to mid-1947, that
an agreement with Moscow would pave the way for reunification and
national elections.</p>
<p>In the Soviet zone there was nobody with Rhee's Korean or international
stature. Instead, the Soviets turned to the thirty-three-year-old Kim
Il-sung, primarily because they believed that he would be fully
subservient to Soviet interests. But they also chose him because of his
proven leadership skills and because he had none of the political
drawbacks of the more established Korean Communists, who had either been
part of 1920s factionalism or joined in the 1930s Soviet purges. Kim
showed both his loyalty and his acumen during his first few months in
power---though he also made it clear that he and his Communist
colleagues aspired to the leadership of all of Korea, not just a part.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-164}Up to the end of 1947 Soviets and
Americans both continued toying with proposals for Korean
self-governance under an international trusteeship as a way to avoid a
conflict between the two powers over control of the peninsula. It is
likely that Stalin did not fully give up on such an approach until the
end of 1948. What cemented the division of Korea was the stubborn
unwillingness of Rhee and Kim to agree to any plan that did not help
reunify Korea under their own rule, along with the intensification of
the Cold War elsewhere in the late 1940s. When the United States gave in
to pressure from Rhee and other anti-Communists to allow separate
elections in the south in May 1948, the die was cast. Rhee had already
started persecuting Communists, trade unionists, and other Leftists. His
victory in the elections was almost a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The change in US thinking about Korea was not just a passive reflection
of the global Cold War. It was influenced by strategic concerns about
the position of the Korean peninsula with regard to both China and
Japan. In China the tide of the civil war was turning against the
American ally Chiang Kai-shek, and the CCP began aiming for national
power through conquest. In Japan the United States needed to create a
regime capable of defeating the domestic Left and form a lasting
alliance with Washington. In both cases Korea was crucial. A presence
there would preserve a US foothold on the mainland in case China fell to
the Communists, and help the United States defend Japan. It would also,
over time, make the Japanese government more self-confident by securing
its strategic position. Having a leadership in southern Korea linked to
the United States therefore became more and more significant for both US
military and civilian planners in the late 1940s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-165}Stalin was less focused on Korea up to
1949, mainly because he struggled to reconceptualize the Soviet role in
China as the CCP, to his great surprise, turned the civil war to its
advantage. Potentially having China within the Communist camp was a
prospect it took some time getting used to, for the Soviet <em>vozhd</em> as
for everyone else. Stalin distrusted the Chinese Communist leaders in
spite of their open devotion to him and to the USSR. But he was of
course alert to the enormous strategic opportunities a Communist regime
in China would offer. His policy of providing assistance to the CCP in
the final stage of its takeover also incorporated Korea. Having
Soviet-controlled northern Korea as a rear base area for CCP forces
fighting in Manchuria was of crucial importance to Communist success
there. The Soviets also helped organize Korean volunteers to fight for
the CCP.</p>
<p>Syngman Rhee declared the Republic of Korea (ROK) in Seoul after the May
1948 elections. Kim Il-sung followed up by declaring a new state from
his northern capital Pyongyang in September. Making it a "People's
Republic" was not enough for Kim; he named it the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), in line with the slogans used at the time. The
new governments got the blessing of their respective Superpower
sponsors. Ironically, Stalin and Truman seem at the time to have
believed that the creation of separate states made war less likely. In
any case, both Soviet and US troops were withdrawn from the Korean
peninsula soon after the new regimes were set up.</p>
<p>As they solidified their governments, the Korean regimes made
preparations for confronting each other. In the north, the Communists
under Soviet guidance restored much of the industrial capacity that the
Japanese has concentrated there. They also carried out a land reform
plan that took land away from landlords, most of whom had worked closely
with the Japanese, and put it in the hands of those who farmed it. The
land reform secured support for the regime among peasants, and improved
food supplies across North Korea. But it also contributed, with other
Communist political campaigns, to hundreds of thousands of refugees
fleeing to the south.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-166}In South Korea, Rhee continued the
crackdown on his enemies, who now extended to many liberal political
leaders who had no sympathy with Communism. He crushed a Communist-led
rebellion in the southern Jeju Island with great loss of life. ROK
troops executed not just suspected guerrillas but their families and in
some cases whole villages. The guerrillas, mostly locals who could draw
on a sense of separate identity on the island, fought on for more than a
year before the rebellion was over. Elsewhere in South Korea strikes
were broken up and independent organizations outlawed under the National
Traitor Act.</p>
<p>Beginning in late 1948 tension increased along the thirty-eighth
parallel. Both sides had plans for attacking across the dividing line,
and almost constant skirmishes contributed to a state of alarm in Seoul
and Pyongyang. What held Rhee and Kim back was that their Superpower
patrons would not support their plans for reunifying the country by
force. The Americans saw themselves well served by the status quo. The
Soviets focused on China. Kim Il-sung made at least two, possibly three,
concrete proposals to Stalin for an attack on South Korea before June
1950. In turning down one of them, in September 1949, the Moscow great
master told Kim that "it is impossible to acknowledge that a military
attack on the south is now completely prepared for and therefore from
the military point of view it is not allowed":</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We, of course, agree with you that the people are waiting for the
unification of the country.... However, until now very little has been
done to raise the broad masses of South Korea to an active struggle, to
develop the partisan movement in all of South Korea, to create there
liberated regions and to organize forces for a general uprising....
Moreover, it is necessary to consider that if military actions begin at
the initiative of the North and acquire a prolonged character, then this
can give to the Americans cause for every kind of interference in Korean
affairs.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en143en">^4^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en143}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-167}Kim was of course unhappy, but could not
act without the Soviets. Then, after the CCP victory in China, Stalin
slowly began to change his mind. According to Soviet documents, there
were at least five reasons why this happened. The success of the Chinese
Communists altered the strategic picture. It also showed that the
Americans were reluctant to intervene on the Asian mainland. In
addition, Stalin was increasingly annoyed by the lack of success he had
against the United States in Europe; the Berlin Blockade fiasco showed
that in full. Based on reports he had been receiving from his main
representative in Pyongyang, Terentii Shtykov, who had headed the Soviet
occupation of Korea and became the first ambassador to the DPRK, the
balance of forces between north and south was now in favor of the
Communists. And according to Stalin's experience with US patterns of
action in Europe, this would not always be the case. Finally, Korea was
a perfect test case for the "internationalism" of the new CCP regime in
China. If they went along with a green light to Kim Il-sung for an
attack, then they would have proven themselves revolutionaries in
practice, not just in theory.</p>
<p>Stalin's eagerness to let the Chinese prove their mettle was stimulated
by his knowledge that Mao was not keen on a war in Korea. The Chinese
leader had told the Soviets so several times. If Mao had a foreign
priority in Asia, it was to help the Viet Minh win decisive victories
over the French in Indochina. Korea, in Mao's mind, could wait. The
Chinese needed time to rebuild their own country and their own forces,
and Korea was too close for comfort to the richest areas of Manchuria
and, for that matter, to the Chinese capital, Beijing. So when Stalin
accepted the need for urgent reunification of Korea by force, during Kim
Il-sung's visit to Moscow in April 1950, the Boss also instructed Kim to
travel immediately to Beijing to get Mao's blessing for the undertaking.
It was a typical Stalin kind of test, reminiscent of the impossible
choice he had given Tito in Yugoslavia two years earlier: If Mao said
yes, he would sign on to an offensive on his own borders over which he
had little say. And if he said no, he would have proven himself to be
less of an international revolutionary leader than Chinese propaganda
indicated.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-168}But Mao could not say no. He was a
Communist internationalist who believed that it was the CCP's duty to
help revolutionaries elsewhere. He also viewed Stalin as the undisputed
head of the international Communist movement and could not countenance
an open challenge to the vozhd's authority. Most important of all, the
Chinese had just reunified their own country by force. How could he
refuse the Korean Communist younger brothers the right to do the
same?<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en144en">^5^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en144} When Kim
Il-sung arrived in Beijing in May 1950, Mao still double-checked with
Moscow first to ensure that Stalin had indeed given his express
go-ahead. Moscow confirmed. "In a conversation with the Korean comrades,
Filippov [one of Stalin's code names] and his friends expressed the
opinion that, in light of the changed international situation, they
agreed with the proposal of the Koreans to move towards
reunification."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en145en">^6^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en145}
Mao told Kim that the Koreans had China's support, too. But he warned
his guest that foreign imperialist intervention might make his task more
difficult than Kim Il-sung assumed.</p>
<p>The preparations for an attack on the south began as soon as Stalin had
given his go-ahead. There were still hundreds of Red Army military
advisers in Korea, and more arrived in May and June. It was mainly the
Soviets who drew up the plans for the offensive, and they based it on
their highly mobile campaigns against Germany and Japan at the end of
World War II. Large amounts of mobile artillery and tanks were sent from
the USSR, with technical staff to prepare and maintain the weapons.
Stalin had made it clear to the Koreans that this would be their war,
but that the Soviet Union would assist as best it could. Kim assured him
that victory would be won within weeks, since hundreds of thousands of
Koreans in the south would rise up against the regime there as the
northern army crossed the thirty-eighth parallel. The time for the
attack was set for late June.</p>
<p>How could the normally cautious and realistic Stalin have sanctioned an
attack on an area that he knew Washington regarded as being within its
sphere? The main reason was that the aging Soviet leader was
increasingly getting caught in his own delusions. The late-1940s' purges
of Communists in eastern Europe, the many "plots" discovered against
Stalin in the USSR, and the treatment of the Yugoslavs and Chinese all
point in the same direction. Though the vozhd may have been somewhat
deranged all along---and his constant scheming against his associates
and complete disregard for human life certainly indicate that---before,
at least, there had been some method to the madness. Stalin's ability to
work exceptionally hard, obtain the necessary information, and
understand how other people thought had, at least in part, compensated
for the intricacies of his mind. But by the late 1940s he had started
taking leave of the flawed but careful reasoning that lay behind his
earlier decisions. Increasingly he acted on his own whims and regarded
himself as being omniscient, at least as far as strategy went. Other
reasons, such as mixed signals in Washington about US plans to defend
South Korea, the first Soviet nuclear test, and Soviet anger over being
stymied in Berlin, probably played a role in the decision. But the
Korean War came from Stalin's change of mind. If he had not given the
go-ahead to Kim, there would have been no war.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-169}At dawn on 25 June, the North Koreans
attacked on a broad front across the thirty-eighth parallel. The plan
was to capture Seoul and then to encircle the South Korean army in the
central part of the country. Over the first week chaos and confusion
reigned on the South Korean side. Seoul fell on the third day of the
offensive, and Rhee fled toward the south. The South Koreans lost
three-quarters of their fighting troops, mostly through defections. The
encirclement plan proved unnecessary because resistance was so light,
although about twenty thousand of Rhee's soldiers did manage to flee to
the southeastern coast. Both sides committed atrocities as the fighting
developed. Rhee's regime massacred Leftists held in their prisons. The
North Koreans executed ROK officials as they advanced. US military
advisers fought on the side of the South Koreans from the very
beginning, and small US reinforcements arrived from Japan during the
second week of the war. Still, in late July Kim Il-sung reported to
Moscow that he expected the war to last less than a month.</p>
<p>Although the North Koreans held the upper hand militarily, the
international reaction to the war already made Kim's prediction
unlikely. Across the world the attack was seen as an element in the Cold
War and not simply a domestic Korean affair. Given the degree to which
the Cold War had become the organizing element in world affairs, such a
reaction was not surprising. In Washington, President Truman immediately
decided that the war was a case of outright Communist aggression,
carried out to further reduce US influence in Asia and to test the will
of the United States and its allies on a global scale. He ordered US
forces to resist. The president also introduced a resolution at the UN
Security Council that condemned the North Korean attack, determined that
it was "a breach of the peace," and ordered an immediate withdrawal. The
resolution passed unopposed because the Soviets were boycotting the
council on account of the US refusal to seat the People's Republic of
China (PRC) there. The following week the Security Council passed a
follow-up resolution, which called for all UN members to "furnish such
assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the
armed attack." It established a unified UN military command in Korea, to
be led by the United States. The UN resolutions were gigantic victories
for the Truman Administration. Not only did they give legitimacy to a US
offensive in Korea, but they also required other countries to assist in
the operation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-170}In the meantime the Soviets were standing
on the sidelines. They claimed that the North Korean "counter-attack"
was a response to a US/South Korean plan to invade the north. Even
though his diplomats asked him to do so, Stalin refused to send his UN
ambassador back to the Security Council to block the second resolution,
which the USSR could easily have vetoed. Stalin sent instructions to
keep a low profile diplomatically, while waiting for the war to conclude
militarily. Even so, it is clear that the Soviet leader was rattled by
the swift reaction from Washington. The Soviets kept hoping that the
offensive would be over before the Americans would be able to intervene
in force. But they, and the Chinese, began to understand that such an
outcome was unlikely.</p>
<p>Because in spite of their rout of the South Korean army, the North
Koreans did not quite succeed in finishing them off. As the remnants
arrived in the southeast, they were joined by ever more powerful US
forces from Japan. Together they were able to establish a perimeter
around the city of Busan and hold it against the northern offensive. The
failure to take Busan made alarm bells go off in Beijing. Mao now
expected some kind of US counterattack. The Soviets remained more
optimistic. As late as mid-August the Red Army general staff reported to
Stalin that they expected the war to be over soon. They were wrong. By
early September the US and South Korean forces were beginning to break
out of the perimeter moving north.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-171}Then, in a daring move that in one stroke
undid the North Korean gains, US-led forces carried out a successful
amphibious landing at Inchon, close to Seoul, on 15 September. US
general Douglas MacArthur, the head of the occupation forces in Japan
whom Truman had put in charge of the offensive in Korea, insisted on
landing that far north both for political and strategic reasons. He
wanted to liberate Seoul, but also to threaten to cut off North Korean
troops in the south of the peninsula. MacArthur succeeded more than even
he could have imagined. The Inchon landings took Kim Il-sung's forces by
surprise. They then prioritized the defense of Seoul over protecting the
strategic corridors farther south. Seoul fell after a week's hard
fighting. By then Kim's forces in the south were all but detached from
their supply lines northward. Under pressure both from the west and the
south, and as well as from intensifying US air strikes, Communist troops
in South Korea started to buckle. By 1 October they fled for the
thirty-eighth parallel, with only a few units able to conduct an orderly
retreat. Close to one hundred thousand surrendered.</p>
<p>MacArthur, who had been given extensive control over how to fight the
war, now called for a full and unconditional North Korean capitulation.
With authorization from Washington, US and allied forces crossed into
North Korea on 7 October. In Moscow, Stalin was furious and accused the
North Koreans of incompetence and his own military advisers of criminal
negligence. But he was still not willing to intervene to help Kim.
Instead he sent a message to Mao on 1 October where Stalin, as often on
receiving bad news, claimed to be on vacation and not fully au courant
with events. But he had learned that "the situation of our Korean
friends is getting desperate." "I think that if in the current situation
you consider it possible to send troops to assist the Koreans, then you
should move at least five-six divisions toward the 38th parallel at
once," the Boss
opined.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en146en">^7^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en146}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-172}Mao knew, of course, that Kim was in bad
straits. He also knew that his countrymen were tired of war and that an
intervention in Korea against US forces would be a risky undertaking,
putting it mildly. Still, the Chinese leader was in an ebullient mood.
He had just won a great civil war and, although he had to fight for it,
he had got the recognition from the Moscow master that he craved.
Crucially, he also believed that revolutionary China would most likely
have to fight a war against the United States at some point anyway. The
imperialists hated and feared the Chinese revolution, Mao thought. He
just could not believe that the United States, as the head of the
imperialist camp, would let a country as important as China leave their
zone without a fight.</p>
<p>The Chinese leadership had been preparing for a possible intervention in
Korea since well before the North Korean attack happened. As soon as he
knew there would be war, Mao had moved forces from the south up to
Manchuria, and he had placed some of his best commanders there. Still,
there were many other military priorities for the new state. The war in
Korea had made some of them more difficult, such as the immediate
takeover of Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-shek's rump government had taken
refuge. Mao was not surprised when he learned that the United States had
moved naval vessels into the Taiwan Straits to protect Chiang shortly
after the outbreak of the war in Korea. After all, Mao regarded the war
as part of a global confrontation between Communism and its opponents,
just as Truman did. But he was concerned that China would have to
prioritize its commitments and aid Kim ahead of other tasks closer to
his heart: taking over Taiwan, aiding the Communists in Vietnam, or more
fully integrating Tibet or Xinjiang into the PRC.</p>
<p>The CCP leadership met in emergency sessions from 2 to 5 October 1950 to
decide on the Chinese intervention. Mao was clear from the very
beginning that he wanted Chinese forces to move into North Korea. Stalin
had requested it. The Chinese Communists owed the Koreans a debt of
gratitude from the civil war. Mao himself had promised Kim assistance if
needed. And, in general, Mao believed China should not be afraid of war.
It was better to fight now than to wait until the Americans were at
China's borders. Mao's whole life had been about war. The chances of him
waiting this one out were very low.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-173}But as North Korean resistance broke
against the US counter-attack, others in the CCP Politburo had second
thoughts. At the first meeting on 2 October there was considerable
reluctance at Mao sending the telegram he had prepared welcoming
Stalin's request. After further discussion, Mao had to change course,
informing the Moscow boss that "we now consider that such actions may
entail extremely serious consequences," and therefore declined the
request for an immediate
intervention.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en147en">^8^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en147} Mao
Zedong may have been the leader of the Chinese revolution, but in the
Politburo, he was still only the first among equals. This would change
soon. Evidence suggests that Mao already the next morning regretted
having given in to the Politburo majority, and convened an extended
meeting of Central Committee members to discuss further. He also brought
in Marshal Peng Dehuai, whom he had already chosen to head the Chinese
expeditionary force, to argue in favor of intervention. Armed with yet
another and more urgent request from Stalin to intervene, on 5 October
Mao was able to get the Politburo to overturn its previous decision and
agree to send up to nine divisions to fight in Korea.</p>
<p>Stalin was well informed about the decision-making process in Beijing.
In his message to Mao of 5 October, he had echoed Mao's own attitude,
saying that "if war cannot be avoided, then let it come now, not several
years hence when Japanese militarism will have recovered and become an
ally of the United
States."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en148en">^9^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en148} Stalin
also promised full Soviet support for a Chinese intervention. Having
made Soviet aid part of his argument to his colleagues, Mao sent Premier
Zhou Enlai to Stalin's dacha on the Black Sea to negotiate the details
directly with the Boss. Stalin was still concerned that too visible a
Soviet participation would draw the USSR directly into the war. In spite
of his earlier promises to Mao, he would not commit much air support
until well after the Chinese intervention had taken place. The Chinese
hesitated. Stalin told Kim on 12 October that since the Chinese would
not send troops, the DPRK leaders and their remaining forces should
evacuate Korea and retreat northward. The following day Mao, again
overruling his Politburo colleagues, made the final decision to
intervene.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-174}While Stalin and Mao prevaricated, the UN
military advance continued. South Korean forces had entered the north on
1 October, and US troops followed them on 9 October. Pyongyang fell to
the UN on 19 October. The Chinese had signaled to the United States on 3
October that they would intervene if American troops crossed into North
Korea, but Washington paid no heed. Truman's and MacArthur's aim was to
force the North Koreans to surrender. The PRC forces, constituted as the
People's Volunteer Army, entered Korea the same day as the North Korean
capital fell, with about two hundred thousand men. US intelligence knew
they were there, but had no idea about their numbers. The Chinese first
turned on the South Korean forces along the border and destroyed them.
Then, on 1 November, they attacked the US First Cavalry Division near
Unsan. The Americans seem to have been wholly unprepared. More than one
thousand US soldiers were killed. Mao was surprised about the outcome,
and ordered the Chinese troops to wait for reinforcements before
proceeding. This led General MacArthur to his biggest miscalculation of
the war, ordering an offensive against the Chinese troops whom he still
believed were few in number.</p>
<p>The result was a complete disaster for the UN forces. The Chinese
counterattack not only destroyed the offensive, with heavy losses on
both sides, but it also gradually forced a UN retreat. In December the
UN was entirely pushed out of North Korea. On 4 January 1951 Seoul fell
to the Communist forces for a second time. General MacArthur argued,
increasingly publicly, that the United States had to take the war to
China. In Washington, the Joint Chiefs of Staff began discussing using
nuclear weapons to end the war. Truman hesitated. He worried about the
Korean War drawing crucial US military resources from Europe, which in
the president's mind was far more important for the Cold War. He also
worried about MacArthur challenging his authority as commander in chief.
When a letter from MacArthur to the Republican leader in the House of
Representatives criticizing the Administration was read out on the House
floor, Truman had had enough. On 11 April he fired the garrulous
general. Truman, in usual style, explained later that "I fired him
because he wouldn't respect the authority of the President. I didn't
fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but
that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to
three-quarters of them would be in
jail."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en149en">^10^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en149}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-175}In mid-March, UN forces retook Seoul for
the second time, and their forces were able to establish and hold a
fragile front line very close to the thirty-eighth parallel. The Chinese
tried to dislodge them in April but failed, mainly due to US air
superiority. Losses on the Chinese side kept rising. In the spring
offensives of 1951 their casualties were sometimes ten times those of
the UN forces. Just in two weeks in May/June the Chinese army lost
forty-five thousand to sixty thousand men. Chinese units also started to
run out of supplies. By June Mao was ready for a cease-fire based on the
status quo. But Stalin demurred. "A drawn out war," the Soviet leader
argued unscrupulously, "gives the possibility to the Chinese troops to
study contemporary warfare on the field of battle and... shakes up the
Truman regime in America and harms the military prestige of the
Anglo-American
troops."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en150en">^11^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en150} Mao did
not want to seem more eager for compromise than the Boss. Syngman Rhee,
now again operating out of the ruins of his capital, enjoined the UN not
to settle before his people were fully liberated. There was to be no
easy peace in Korea.</p>
<p>When the Chinese attacked US troops in the fall of 1950 people
everywhere thought that they were heading fast toward World War III. A
fifteen-year-old in Connecticut wrote to President Truman at the
outbreak of the war to tell him how she could not sleep when she heard
planes passing overhead, "afraid any minute we all would be
killed."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en151en">^12^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en151}
Countless others, in North America, Europe, and Asia, must have felt the
same way. The US Administration hoped they could keep the war contained.
Truman realized that he had to strike a balance between using Korea to
get public support in the United States for a global containment policy
and increased military expenditure, while avoiding a full-fledged war
scare. Always given to hyperbole, Truman at first struck that balance
badly. In an address to the American people in December, the president
claimed that "our homes, our Nation, all the things we believe in, are
in great danger": "This danger has been created by the rulers of the
Soviet Union.... In June, the forces of communist imperialism broke out
into open warfare in Korea.... Then, in November, the communists threw
their Chinese armies into the battle against the free nation. By this
act, they have shown that they are now willing to push the world to the
brink of a general war to get what they want. This is the real meaning
of the events that have been taking place in Korea. This is why we are
in such grave
danger."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en152en">^13^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en152}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-176}With an ever-larger number of Americans
believing that global war might break out very soon, the anti-Communist
excesses that had started in the 1940s went into overdrive at home.
Senator McCarthy and his supporters, such as the freshman senator from
California, Richard Nixon, attacked the Administration for being soft on
Communism within the United States. The government responded by having
loyalty boards investigate millions of employees. They were asked what
civic groups they belonged to, what reading habits they had, and whether
they knew any Communists. Thousands of journalists, artists, and
ordinary workers were blacklisted and prevented from getting jobs
because they refused to join in the frenzy. Teachers and other public
employees---in one state even postal workers and grave diggers---were
required to swear oaths of loyalty to the Constitution.</p>
<p>In Europe, too, the Korean War intensified the Cold War. Western
European leaders worried that Korea was just a Soviet test case.
France's Charles de Gaulle wondered whether "these local actions were
tests... to prepare for the 'great shock' of a final push through
Europe. Of course, Europe is the central, pivotal region to complete the
unification of the Eurasian sphere under Soviet domination, with the
loss of freedom as a
consequence."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en153en">^14^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en153}
The French Communists, for their part, followed the Soviet line: "Clear
Provocation of War from the Puppets of Washington in Korea," screamed
the headline of their newspaper <em>L'Humanité</em> the day after the North
Korean attack. "The People's Army strikes back victoriously against the
aggression of South Korean troops!"</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-177}But the conflict had other effects as
well. Fears of nuclear warfare spread. In some western European
countries radicals were blacklisted from work just like in the United
States, although levels of persecution in western Europe never got close
to what Communist regimes had imposed in the east. The South Korean
cause itself never had much resonance in western Europe, and Soviet and
Communist propaganda, saying that the war was a US attack on an innocent
people, did have some effect. Most people simply wanted the conflict to
end before it spread to their part of the world.</p>
<p>In Japan, close to Korea and with its history of colonialism there, the
reaction to the war was one of both fear and opportunity. Most Japanese
were afraid that the war would spread to their islands, through a Soviet
nuclear attack or a Chinese invasion. There were significant antiwar
protests. Japan, after all, was the only country in the world that had
already suffered a nuclear attack. But among political leaders and
businessmen there was also a sense of opportunity. They knew that the
war would make the United States more dependent on Japanese support, and
that Japanese industry was in a better position than anyone else to
supply the US armies in Korea. Japan did experience a significant
economic upturn during the war. Even more importantly, the war ended the
US occupation and made Japan a valued ally of the United States. Syngman
Rhee and other South Korean leaders hated the thought, but the fact was
that their regime could not have been rescued without Japanese
assistance.</p>
<p>In the Third World no country or movement did much to support the US
cause. India insisted, from the very beginning, on an end to the war and
a withdrawal to the thirty-eighth parallel. Others were even more
critical. Comments and editorials in the Middle East and statements by
African liberation movements asked not unreasonable questions about US
policy. Why had the United States intervened immediately against North
Korea, when it did little to throw France out of Algeria or end
apartheid in South Africa? The first major apartheid law, the Population
Registration Act, was signed the same week as the Korean War broke out.
And yet South African forces participated on the UN side in Korea.
Though it was not known at the time, it was aircraft from the South
African fighter squadron that killed Mao Zedong's son Mao Anying, who
served as an officer in Korea, in November 1950.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-178}For the Truman Administration it mattered
more that it had succeeded in putting together an international
coalition than who served in it. Because of the unprecedented UN
mandate, sixteen countries sent troops to Korea. The biggest contingents
came from Britain, Turkey, the Philippines, and Thailand. France,
Greece, and the Low Countries also sent troops, as did some countries of
the British Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). Still,
almost 90 percent of the UN troops in Korea were American. Even more
importantly, all UN troops fought under US command.</p>
<p>But while the war in Korea may have helped America's international
alliances, it probably did even more to facilitate Sino-Soviet
cooperation. After the Chinese intervention took place, the Soviets
stepped up their assistance, supplying much of the materiel the Chinese
and North Korean forces needed. The Soviets also sent more military
advisers and, crucially, more airplanes and anti-aircraft artillery.
From April 1951 Stalin allowed Soviet pilots to fly combat missions, as
long as they stayed within North Korean airspace. Around eight hundred
Soviet pilots flew in Korea, mostly in MiG-15 fighter jets, which were
the most advanced Soviet aircraft available. During the war both the
level of cooperation and the mutual confidence of the Chinese and the
Soviet side increased substantially, in spite of occasional
disagreements over tactics among the three allies.</p>
<p>The Korean War also had a profound influence on China domestically. In
1950, the Chinese had longed for peace after almost twenty years of war.
There was substantial dissatisfaction with having to send young men to
war again, this time abroad. Even some soldiers demurred. They asked
themselves why they had to be marched from southern China all the way up
to Korea to fight in a foreign war, just after victory had been achieved
at home. As casualties rose, some even harder questions were asked. A
Chinese captain at the battle of Chosin Reservoir remembered "when we
moved up the hill just twelve days ago... two hundred young men were
running and jumping, full of energy and heroic dreams."</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-179}Tonight there were only six of them. Tired
and wounded, they moved slowly down the hill. Covered by dust and blood,
their faces and arms were black like charcoals. Their uniforms were
ragged, shabby, and torn at the elbows. They looked like ghosts walking

from China all the way to Korea. [Most] could never go back to their
homes and see their families. They were only nineteen or twenty years
old, and dropped their last blood on this foreign
land.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en154en">^15^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en154}
:::</p>
<p>In Korea the destruction was immense. Most parts of the country had been
consumed by war at least twice during the campaigns. All the cities were
in ruins. About half the population were refugees. Most production had
been destroyed and there was widespread hunger throughout the war. Those
who tried to hang on in the cities faced a grim fate when war rolled
back in. In the second battle for Seoul, "the artillery duels were
taking a terrific toll of Korean civilians," according to news reports.
"All day and all night women, little children and old men were being
brought by pushcart, oxen or litter into the regimental command post in
the pathetic hope that the frantically busy doctors could pause long
enough to tend to
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en155en">^16^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en155}</p>
<p>Even though armistice talks started in the summer of 1951, the war
itself rolled on for two more dreadful years, without any meaningful
military gains being made by either side. Neither the UN forces nor the
Chinese and North Korean commanders were willing to gamble on a
large-scale offensive that might yield little or nothing at all. But the
armistice talks were also going nowhere. One sticking point was how to
handle the prisoner of war issue. The Chinese and North Koreans insisted
on repatriation of all prisoners, even those who did not want to return.
The Americans maintained that they would repatriate only those who
wanted to go back. Meanwhile, the prisoner of war camps in the south
developed into veritable battlegrounds of their own, where Communist
groups fought anti-Communist wardens put in place by the Americans and
the South Koreans. In one of them,</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-180}In early 1952, the brigade leader, Li
Da'an, wanted to tattoo every prisoner in Compound 72 with an
anti-Communist slogan.... He ordered the prisoner guards to beat those
who refused the tattoo.... One prisoner, however, Lin Xuepu, continued
to refuse.... Li Da'an finally dragged Lin up to the stage.... "Do you
want it or not?" Bleeding and barely able to stand up, Lin, a nineteen
year old college freshman, replied with a loud "No!" Li Da'an responded
by cutting off one of Lin's arms with his big dagger. Lin screamed but
still shook his head when Li repeated the question. Humiliated and
angry, Li followed by stabbing Lin with his dagger. After Lin finally
collapsed, Li opened Lin's chest and pulled out his heart. Holding the
bleeding but still beating heart, Li yelled to all the prisoners in the
field: "Whoever dares to refuse the tattoo will be like
him!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en156en">^17^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en156}
:::</p>
<p>Neither Rhee nor Kim wanted an armistice. They still insisted that all
of the country had to be "liberated." And, crucially, Stalin had no
interest in letting the war end. The more the Americans were bogged down
in Asia, the better it was for his positions in Europe.</p>
<p>Already by early 1951 the war was getting increasingly unpopular in the
United States, with two-thirds of Americans believing that the United
States should pull out of Korea
altogether.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en157en">^18^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en157} The
news media increasingly asked hard questions about the purpose of the
war. Calling Korea "a miserable country to die in," in January 1953 one
reporter let his readers know that where he was, "three of our men got
it last night." One of them had "graduated from a small southwestern
college last August. Korea in October. Dead in January.... They were
killed near a bend in the Imjin River between two hills we've named
Chink Baldie and Pork
Chop."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en158en">^19^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en158} In less
than four days in mid-February 1951, the United States had more than
1,300 battle casualties.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-181}The state of the war contributed to Harry
Truman's decision not to run again for president in 1952. General Dwight
Eisenhower, who ran on the Republican ticket, promised an early end to
the war, through tough measures if necessary. But he had no recipe for
how to do so. When he won the election, Eisenhower mixed threats
(including about considering the use of nuclear weapons) with
blandishments (putting pressure on the South Koreans to accept a
cease-fire). Right after his inauguration, Eisenhower agreed to an
exchange of wounded prisoners without any preconditions. He also
signaled an interest in comprehensive Indian proposals for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>Then, on 5 March, the news came that changed everything. Stalin had
died. On 1 March the dictator had, as often before, had a late meal with
cronies at one of his dachas outside of Moscow. The next day there was
no sound from his apartment. Under strict orders never to enter
uninvited, the guards did not dare open the door until about 10:00 p.m.
They found Stalin laying on the floor. He had had a massive stroke,
which immediately incapacitated him. As his successors tried to pull
things together, while warily keeping an eye on each other, the one
matter on which they did agree was to end the Korean War. They regarded
its continuation as dangerous and unnecessary, and hoped its end would
signal to the United States an intent to lessen tensions.</p>
<p>The Communist leaders who inherited Stalin's Soviet Union were right
that the Korean War had grown increasingly dangerous, even after the
front lines stopped shifting. One of the most significant effects the
war had on the Cold War was to militarize the conflict on a global
scale. The US defense budget more than doubled, with only part of that
increase going to fight the war in Korea. NATO, which up to the summer
of 1950 had been mainly a political organization, now started becoming
an integrated military force. US military assistance to Britain and
France intensified, as did US determination to re-arm West Germany.
Nuclear weapons programs were put into high gear. Perhaps most important
was the perception, promoted by the Eisenhower Administration, that US
commitment to protect associates abroad had to be total. The Cold War
was a zero-sum game. Any further reasoning invited enemy attack.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter006.xhtml#page-182}The Korean armistice was signed almost
exactly three years after the war broke out. The Communist powers
accepted most of the proposals that had been holding up negotiations
before. It had been a useless and terrible war for everyone involved.
Worse, though, were the consequences for Korea itself. The country was
devastated. Three and a half million Koreans had died or been wounded in
the war. Ten million were dependent on food aid. Just in the south,
there were at least one hundred thousand orphans without any known
living
relatives.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en159en">^20^</a>{#chapter006.xhtml#en159} Those
Koreans who could return to their towns and villages saw death and
despair everywhere. Their foreign allies attempted to ameliorate the
situation, in return for integrating "their" Korea into their respective
alliance systems. But for the Koreans themselves the war was a national
catastrophe, leaving scars that have not yet healed and miseries that
have not yet gone away.

<p>From the 1940s to the 1960s one alternative world covered the globe from
the Arctic through the center of Europe to the Adriatic, and from there
through the Caucasus and central Asia to Korea and the city of
Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean. That city's name, meaning "the
conqueror of the east," now symbolized Communist victory in a very large
part of Eurasia. But the Communist world did not stop there. From
Vladivostok it moved south, through China, the most populous country on
earth, to end off the shores of Vietnam, in the South China Sea. What is
remarkable about this world is how it was connected. It was not just a
security alliance, such as NATO was for the north Atlantic states. It
was an integrationist political and economic project, built on a common
understanding of how the world worked and how it ought to be changed. It
based itself on the teachings of Marx and Lenin, and on the practices
that had developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin. It was fiercely
protective of its unity and committed to supporting the Soviet Union in
the Cold War. It was, or so it seemed, a full-fledged alternative to
capitalism and a rebuke to those who believed the United States was the
great victor of the Second World War.</p>
<p>Everywhere, the imposition of Communist rule was based on military
power. In eastern Europe and North Korea the Soviet Red Army helped put
Communist regimes in place. In China, Yugoslavia, and Albania, local
Communist armies took power on their
own.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en160en">^1^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en160} But in all
cases their leaders identified the Communist military takeover with a
socialist revolution. They left behind Marx's concepts of capitalism
under bourgeois rule gradually developing the foundations of socialism.
Like Stalin, they believed that Communist regimes could create socialism
in their own countries, especially since the Soviet Union had blazed a
path for such development. But the realization of socialism under
Communist rule would have to happen in stages, so as to conform to the
Marxist elements of Stalinism. The regimes were therefore forced to
claim that they at first represented a "national" revolution, which
would then later go on to develop socialism, because that was the best
for the nation. With a dishonesty remarkably similar to private
companies claiming that they are acting for the public good, Communists
claimed to be acting for all the nation, even though their programs were
blatantly intent on empowering some social classes and marginalizing
others.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-184}Among the biggest difficulties for
Communists in power everywhere was their claim to stand for the
international. The future, they said, belonged to the proletarians and
the peasants---to classes, not to nation-states. The problem was that
for many ordinary people in the 1940s and '50s, a strong nation-state
was what they wished for most. The war had shown what would happen to
those groups who did not have the protection of their own state. The
massive bloodletting in eastern Europe, the mass murders of Jews and
Roma, and the moving of borders had made it possible for Poles,
Hungarians, or Romanians to claim their countries to be nation-states.
The Communists, even when professing to carry out a "national"
revolution, also had to stand for internationalism, especially since
Moscow made that the test case for the loyalty of each Communist regime.
From the very beginning, therefore, the Communists had a troubled
relationship with concepts of nation and nationhood, or even state
independence.</p>
<p>The Communist parties were minorities everywhere. The Hungarian
Communist party, for instance, had only around three thousand members
when the war
ended.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en161en">^2^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en161} They
therefore had to depend on surveillance and the use of force to stay in
power. The techniques they used were copied from those developed by the
Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution or, in some cases, from the
Nazis or the authoritarian regimes of the interwar years. Although
workplace dismissals, expropriations, secret arrests, labor camps, and
terror against real or imagined opponents were used everywhere, there
were big differences in the number of people who died. In China, as we
have seen, more than two million were killed in the first two years of
Communist rule. In Hungary the number was about five hundred, and in
Czechoslovakia less than two hundred. The difference is probably
explained both by the character of the regime and by the situation the
leaders were in. In China there had been a long civil war, turning into
an international war in Korea, while in Czechoslovakia violence in the
taking of power had been relatively slight. But the Chinese Communists
also believed in a swift transformation of their country, and liked to
use the phrase that one cannot make an omelet without breaking
eggs.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en162en">^3^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en162} As seen
from Prague, the realization of Communism was a slower concoction.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-185}In all of the Communist states, there was
of course much change over time. Even though the Communist parties were
in power, they still had to build a state and get some form of
cooperation from the population. While Stalin was alive, it was hard to
get on with these essential tasks, because the aging dictator took them
through a series of increasingly capricious campaigns, purges, and
changes in policy. After Stalin's death in 1953, the eastern European
regimes turned toward stability and economic growth. This deliberate
lessening of tension by the Communists made protest more possible, as in
East Germany in 1953 or Poland and Hungary in 1956. But it also made it
easier for the population to collaborate with the regimes. For most
people, after all, the Communist regimes were simply the new
authorities, and socialism increasingly the new normality. Over time a
degree of mutuality between rulers and ruled developed. Those in power
at the lower levels could fashion official policy to suit them. Workers
used solidarity with their workmates to carve out space free from direct
Communist interference. But more and more people also participated in
the regime's organizations, events, or festivals. By the early 1960s
some form of uneasy truce had arrived between rulers and ruled, in the
Soviet Union itself as well as in eastern Europe (but not in China,
where Stalinist-style campaigns were intensified rather than abated).</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-186}<strong>I[N SPITE OF]{.small-caps}</strong> all the
geographical and economic differences among new Communist states, the
Communists set off in similar directions everywhere. At the beginning
there was much that could be based on common models, often lifted
directly from Soviet practices. Most of the Communist countries were
heavily agricultural, so their leaders wanted to maximize state income
from the land. They therefore decreed collectivization so the state
could keep the profit from agricultural production and control the
farmers politically. They also believed that the Soviet model had shown
collective farming to be more effective, more industrial, and therefore
more modern than individual farms. But collectivization was often
resented by farmers, who believed they would do better in working their
own land themselves. Much as in their relationship with the nation, the
Communists were caught in a developmental quandary with regard to
agriculture. They argued that collective farming was the future, just at
the very moment when many farmers, from eastern Europe to China, had
begun to sell their produce for cash, and therefore saw opportunities in
linking up to the capitalist market.</p>
<p>The methods by which Stalin and his henchmen had pushed through Soviet
collectivization in the 1930s had been one of the worst crimes of his
regime. No other Communist state acted with the same degree of
ruthlessness, possibly because even the Soviets had become alert to the
costs. All over eastern Europe collectivization progressed slowly, and
in Poland the process was a complete failure; the Communist government
there simply gave up on account of massive resistance by
farmers---Polish collective farms never covered more than 10 percent of
the country's arable land. Elsewhere collectivization continued apace,
with a mix of incentives and pressure. For some farmers, especially in
the less developed countries, incentives such as access to technology
were important. The new policies also appealed to some of the collective
values of rural society. But nowhere did farmers give up their right to
own their own land without some form of resistance. Even in China, where
the main phase of collectivization was completed in record time in 1955
and where it had been preceded by massive terror against the bigger
landowners, many peasants did demur. Given a choice, they would have
preferred to own the land they cultivated.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-187}The central tenet of Communist economic
change was industrialization. The pattern again was taken from the
Soviet Union. Only by industrializing fast could a country become
socialist and modern. The policy had an obvious appeal: in countries on
the European periphery, where there was a profound sense of having
fallen behind, and in countries outside of Europe, such as China, Korea,
and Vietnam, rapid industrialization seemed indeed to be the way
forward. Everyone was bewitched by the extraordinary role of Soviet
industrial production in destroying Nazi Germany. The emphasis was
always on heavy industry: steel, machinery, shipyards, and on the mining
and drilling that served such industries. Big enterprises had the
priority, and almost all investment went to capital projects. Consumer
goods were lacking, and for those that were available, shortages and
queuing were the rules from the very beginning of Communist governments.</p>
<p>The ideal was that all economic activity should be run by the state, and
that the measure of the economy was production volume, not competition
or exchange. Planning and centralization therefore played a big part in
all Communist economies. As we have seen, elements of planning were not
uncommon for the postwar era even among non-Communists. But the
difference was the totality of the plan: in the Communist world it
covered everything, from household consumption to steel production. By
the early 1960s, 100 percent of the national income in the USSR and
Bulgaria was produced by state and collective enterprises, and most
other Communist countries had similar
figures.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en163en">^4^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en163} Private
ownership was abolished through expropriations.</p>
<p>A fully planned economy was based on the government deciding the
priorities for production. Government ministries then issued production
quotas, which factories strove to fulfill. The allocation of raw
materials, energy, and workers was decided centrally, based on
calculations of how much was needed to achieve the quotas on time.
Transport, repairs, or new machinery were requested by the individual
factory and decided on, according to political priority, by state
institutions allocated such tasks. Investment and output were imagined
to be in perfect balance, and resources therefore utilized to the
utmost. Distribution replaced the market as a mechanism of dividing the
output. No factories ever closed, and no workers were laid off. There
was therefore full employment at all times. The country was a socialist
economic machine, the purpose of which was to maximize production.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-188}Reality, of course, diverged rather
substantially from this economic ideal, as did capitalist practices from
free market thinking in nonsocialist countries. Although much was
achieved in terms of increasing production during the first decades of
full economic planning, mainly in industry (socialist agriculture always
lagged behind), growth slowed later. Some of this is undoubtedly
explained by the first phase of growth being pushed forward simply by
unrealized potential from earlier decades. The resource advantages of
centralization in an underdeveloped economy played a part in initial
successes, as did the enthusiasm of workers to rebuild and see their
factories and countries succeed. But there were also inefficiencies
built into the planned economy, which became more glaring as economies
matured. There was a lack of efficient allocation, innovation, and
product differentiation. There was also a lack of incentives for
workers, and a lack of economizing or preservation of resources, natural
or industrial.</p>
<p>With industrialization came urbanization, and the transformation of
peasants into workers on an unprecedented scale. Bulgaria, for example,
was predominantly rural in 1945. Less than a quarter of the population
lived in cities. By 1965 that figure was doubled, and more than half the
population worked in industry. This process was replicated---although
usually at a slower rate---all over the Communist states. As all
processes of rapid social change, it had its push and pull factors. For
many, the opportunity to live in a city and to learn new skills was
attractive. But some were driven out of their villages by the effects of
collectivization or by Communist party pressure to join the ranks of
industrial workers. Aspiring to be a worker was a badge of honor in all
Communist-ruled states.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-189}The Communist regimes constructed new
centers of production, which were supposed to be ideal sites for
factories and for workers. In these new towns---Nowa Huta in Poland,
Dimitrovgrad in Bulgaria, or Sztálinváros (Stalin City) in
Hungary---socialist planning efforts were taken to the extreme. Big
plants were built in the cities, with modern apartments for workers in
high-rise buildings close by. Schools and kindergartens were run in
cooperation between city authorities and the factories where people
worked, as were clinics, sports grounds, and concert halls; evening
classes were offered for workers who wanted to further their education.
All was free of charge or available for a nominal fee. No wonder people
such as Mateusz Birkut, the impoverished hero of Polish director Andrzej
Wajda's magnificent film <em>Man of Marble</em>, flocked to the new socialist
towns in great numbers. Though many of their hopes were to be dashed,
for the emergent working class in eastern Europe or in China, such
initiatives symbolized a future that they found attractive.</p>
<p>For most workers the transition to socialism held out considerably fewer
rewards. Though everyone appreciated job security and a steady
income---especially those who had experienced the 1930s---living
conditions were still poor and the shortages of consumer goods and
sometimes even food clashed with socialist ideals of plenty. Even worse
was the lack of working-class autonomy. All over eastern Europe workers
had tasted influence and power of their own in the immediate postwar
years. In some areas factory councils had taken over the running of
plants or negotiated deals with the owners. By the late 1940s Communist
trade unions came in and took over workers' organizations, and officials
appointed by the authorities were the new bosses. They set production
quotas after instructions from above, and workers had little influence
on their daily existence. Workers protested everywhere, with some
condemning the Communists as Nazis in disguise. Gradually, in the
post-Stalin era the authorities tried to buy off workers' protests
through accepting lower levels of productivity and increasing subsidies
on food and rent.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-190}One of the biggest changes throughout the
Communist world was in the position of women. All over eastern Europe
and eastern Asia the position of women had been governed by patriarchal
traditions that gave them little say over resources, work, or family
affairs. In areas that had had a taste of capitalism, new opportunities
for women were mixed with increased social and economic exploitation.
The Communist parties set out to change this sorry state of affairs, and
at first many women were able to benefit from the new policies. Access
to education, work, and child care improved dramatically in many places.
So did women's control of their own lives. The right to divorce and
availability of birth control made for big changes in gender relations.
But women were still kept out of political leadership positions, and as
the regimes wanted to increase their populations, many women found
themselves increasingly caught between work and duties to their
families. The dual burden on women turned out to be as troublesome in
societies that called themselves socialist as they were in the
capitalist countries, and the on-going conflict between progressive
ideas and traditional norms at least as intense.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why Communist regimes cherished women's return to the
domestic sphere after first having enabled them to make other choices
was the gradual militarization of society. The Cold War played a
significant role in this. As was the case in the capitalist countries,
the Communists needed new soldiers for their armies, and falling birth
rates did not serve that purpose. But the Communists' fondness for the
military was not only connected to defense. Many Communists admired
military organization as a supreme form of modernity. For them, or at
least for those who had never served in the military themselves,
military organization equaled efficiency and the maximum use of
resources. It was the principles of the assembly line and of planning
put into practice on a grand scale. Enormous new military parade grounds
came to define Communist states. To many Communists, in Stalin's Russia
and Mao's China especially, society ought to be organized as a machine
that worked in a military manner, with commands being executed,
positions conquered, and enemies destroyed. Such societies had no use
for those with their own agendas or for doubters or dissenters.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-191}The idea about the tight organization of
society and the state often led to the idolization of the supreme
leader, the symbol of the collective efforts. Such adoration was
hard-wired into the Communist system, although it took different forms
under different circumstances. In the worst cases leaders used it to
establish a personal dictatorship, as in the cases of Stalin or Mao
Zedong, or the "little Stalins" who emerged all over eastern Europe
during the <em>vozhd</em>'s rule. North Korea under Kim Il-sung was another
crude example. The Soviet national anthem claimed, "We were raised by
Stalin to be true to the people, To labor and heroic deeds he inspired
us!" But even when the cult of the leader was less intense, the
hierarchical and authoritarian remained. Rituals and festivals, and even
shrines, were set up to honor the leader. Though atheist in principle,
it is hard not to suspect a certain craving for the sacred in Communist
attachment to their high priests and the political theory they
represented.</p>
<p>For those who could not believe, or were excluded from the fold,
Communism was grim and repressive. Surveillance was the order of the
day. The regimes had spies who helped them control the population. To
begin with, at least, a wrong word could get you into big trouble. As
often happens, for instance in the United States during the McCarthy
era, some people made use of reporting on others to settle private
scores. But the Communist parties went further than sheer control. Whole
social or ethnic groups were suspected of enemy activity and excluded
from society. Class enemies, of course, included the former aristocracy
or those who owned property, shops, or factories, but also teachers,
writers, or people with foreign or minority background. In Stalin's last
years, Jews were singled out for persecution. The point was to force
everyone to conform to Communist ideals, though as time went by, a mere
passive conformity gradually became enough. In the Soviet Union,
campaigns against enemies peaked as the Cold War hardened in the late
1940s, even if mass executions ended. The population in forced labor
camps, under the GULag system, reached its highest number, about two and
a half million people, in the early 1950s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-192}Even though resistance was hard, people
obviously did resist. Under the rule of the great dictators Stalin or
Mao, or even Kim Il-sung, in most people's minds conformism won over
resistance time and again because the price paid for opposition was so
great. But after Stalin's death in 1953, people began to oppose the
authorities in greater numbers, especially in the Soviets' newly won
empire in eastern Europe. Most of this was everyday workers' resistance:
shirking work, pilfering from the factory, boycotting Communist marches
or festivals, reading forbidden literature, or cursing the government
when sitting around the kitchen table at home. Some went further,
organizing underground meetings or distributing leaflets. Troubling for
the authorities, most often it was not the hated bourgeoisie that
committed such infractions. It was the sons and daughters of the working
class, the very group the Communists pretended to represent. Sometimes
the government cracked down, and the perpetrators of such small
liberties ended up in prison or labor camps. Overall, however, the
governments in eastern Europe managed to hold the fort through warning
people off, or by playing up fears of Soviet intervention or German
revanchism.</p>
<p>But in East Germany in 1953 resistance boiled over into open rebellion.
It began in June when workers in Berlin demanded better working
conditions and better pay. When the Communist government prevaricated,
forty thousand protesters assembled in East Berlin and marched on the
party headquarters. A general strike was proclaimed. On 17 June the
Communists panicked and called in armed police, supported by Soviet
troops. At least one hundred people died in the fighting, and several
thousand were arrested. The number of skilled workers departing for West
Berlin, already high, increased sharply. In Moscow, the new post-Stalin
leaders understood that their German problem had not gone away.</p>
<p>Behind the workers' protest in East Germany lay years of dissatisfaction
with Communist rule. First, there was the Red Army terror in 1945--46,
and the removal of industrial machinery as reparations to the Soviet
Union. Then, the 1948 Berlin Blockade increased the sense of isolation
in the Soviet occupation zone. When the Soviets and the German
Communists agreed to set up a new German state within the Red Army zone
of occupation in October 1949, they did so based on the de facto
division of the country that the currency reforms had created. Although
most Germans in the east longed for a united Germany free of foreign
occupation, the disasters they had been through also made them realists.
They wanted to make the most of the situation in the new Communist
German Democratic Republic, which was supposed to be a socialist
workers' state. Among some workers there were hopes for increased
autonomy and better livelihood. Famous German writers such as Bertolt
Brecht and Stefan Heym returned to settle in East Germany. Heym, who had
fought in the US Army during the war, wrote a letter to President
Eisenhower, in which he renounced his US citizenship, condemned the war
in Korea, and returned the Bronze Star he had been awarded for bravery.
For Brecht and Heym, the German Democratic Republic was the good
Germany.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-193}But the German Communists, as Communists
in governments elsewhere, wanted to accentuate production over workers'
participation. They were not keen on the involvement of intellectuals,
except as mouthpieces for the regime. The East German leader Otto
Grotewohl, in his speech at the founding of the GDR, told his audience
that reconstruction was the main business of the new regime: "The German
cities, towns and villages which have been destroyed, the ruined houses
and factories will not rise up again if the German people simply twiddle
their thumbs. All true Germans must therefore work together to overcome
the consequences of the war as quickly as possible, and to reconstruct a
free, democratic and peace-loving
Germany."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en164en">^5^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en164}</p>
<p>The unrest in Berlin and other East German cities in 1953 came as a
result of the regime's impatience. By again increasing the output quotas
for industry, the Communists reminded the workers that the party would
construct socialism through their hard work. During the first part of
the demonstrations, the workers' demands were therefore mainly economic:
"Away with inflated norms!" "Increase wages now!" "Reduce food prices!"
But soon the slogans changed to the political: "For free elections!"
"Release all political prisoners!" "Freedom of speech!" After the
rebellion had been crushed, the East German Communists blamed foreign
agitators for the unrest, claiming that the rebellion had been a
"fascist coup attempt": "Through their agents and other people bought by
them..., the aggressive forces of German and American monopoly capital
succeeded in influencing parts of the population in the capital Berlin
and some other places in the Republic to strike and demonstrate," said
the Communist Central
Committee.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en165en">^6^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en165} They
wanted the population to rededicate itself to hard work. Bertolt Brecht
wrote scathingly, in a poem he did not dare publish at the time, about
how the Communist leaders claimed that the people had failed the
government and had to work hard to regain its trust. Would it not then
be simpler, the old satirist wrote of his own regime, if "the government
dissolved the people / and chose
another?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en166en">^7^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en166}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-194}The dilemma between satisfying workers'
pent up demands and defending the socialist state was precisely the
challenge of the new Soviet leadership after Stalin. The group that had
come to power---Georgii Malenkov as premier, Lavrentii Beriia as head of
the secret police, Nikita Khrushchev as party first secretary,
Viacheslav Molotov as foreign minister, Nikolai Bulganin as defense
minister---feared the collapse of Communist rule as much as they feared
and distrusted each other. Through his brutality and the respect he
commanded, Stalin had been the guarantor of Communist rule and the final
adjudicator of all things political. With him gone, his Kremlin
successors all agreed that tension had to be reduced and compromises
found if the Soviet state and its alliances were not to be seriously
threatened. The first signal of new policies was the sudden release of
the Jewish doctors arrested by Stalin, who were accused of trying to
murder him and other Soviet leaders. Beriia, as the former head of the
secret police, may have tried to cover his own tracks by announcing that
this and other cases were violations of "socialist legality." Unnerved
by Beriia's vigorous involvement in policy-making, the other leaders
conspired against him, and he was arrested in July 1953 and executed by
the end of the year. According to several witnesses, General Pavel
Batitskii, the commander of the Moscow Air Defense Region, shot the most
feared man in Russia through the head at close range when he would not
willingly walk to the execution
ground.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en167en">^8^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en167}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-195}The killing of Beriia, who had been the
symbol of Stalinist repression, did little to enable the surviving
leaders to find new policies. Even the freeing of some of Stalin's
prisoners was controversial. Hearing of the doctors' release, a female
railway worker wrote a complaint, oozing anti-Semitism and allegiance to
the great leader: "We lost our great friend and father, our beloved
Iosif Vissarionovich [Stalin], and the tears on our face will still
not dry, the trepidation in people's hearts over our future had not
calmed, when the stunning news spread, and the terrible thought pierced
people's brains---enemies of the people are free. They once more have
the right to commit their dark acts, to wreck mankind's peaceful work,
and to receive praise and rewards from their American-English
bosses."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en168en">^9^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en168}</p>
<p>Even so, the new leadership, among whom Nikita Khrushchev slowly emerged
as the head, went ahead with gradually setting free many of those
imprisoned in the GULag. While labor camps would continue to exist right
up to the end of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev removed them as a key part
of the country's economy, which under Stalin had been completely
dependent on prison labor. Hundreds of thousands of
prisoners---political protesters, petty thieves, foreign soldiers, those
who belonged to the "wrong" nationality, and those many who had no idea
why they had been arrested---started to emerge from the camps, and
struggled to get home or find a new place in society. These are the
people the Russian Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn immortalized in
<em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</em> and the process Ilya Ehrenburg
called "The Thaw." But Khrushchev himself later admitted that the new
leaders "were scared---really scared. We were afraid that the thaw might
unleash a flood, which we wouldn't be able to control and which would
drown us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en169en">^10^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en169}</p>
<p>Nikita Khrushchev was born close to the Russian-Ukraine border in 1894,
and moved from his village to the industrial city of Donetsk when he was
fourteen. With less than four years of formal schooling, he was lucky to
get a job as a metal fitter's apprentice. He joined the local Soviet
when it was set up in 1917, and fought with the Red Army in the civil
war, in which his first wife died. After the civil war he combined
political posts in the Ukraine with evening studies of technical
subjects. He was an active participant in carrying out Stalin's purges
in the 1930s and during World War II served in political roles on the
front against Germany, ending as party leader and premier of Ukraine.
Here he carried out the Communist revenge against those who had worked
with the Germans or sought independence. In Stalin's final years he was
the party boss of Moscow and ever closer to the dictator himself.
Underestimated and sometimes mocked by his rivals for power because of
his lack of schooling and his boorish manners, Khrushchev outmaneuvered
them all and became the top leader---now called First Secretary---of the
Communist Party in 1953 and head of the government five years later.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-196}In his first years in power Khrushchev had
to work closely with his colleagues to formulate policy. Among their
biggest challenges were eastern Europe and China. Khrushchev was intent
on strengthening the alliance with the Chinese. To his advisers he often
commented that Stalin had been crazy not to immediately embrace the
Chinese revolution. "We will live like brothers with the Chinese," he
was fond of saying, and his first major foreign trip was to Beijing,
where he massively increased Soviet economic support for
China.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en170en">^11^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en170} Eastern
Europe seemed more difficult. The new Soviet leaders understood that
some of Stalin's policies had created the resistance that had boiled to
the surface after his death, not just in East Germany but elsewhere as
well. But they were also afraid that the East German rebellion could be
repeated elsewhere if they were not careful. By late 1953 they had
therefore developed what they called a "new course," which was intent on
reform without weakening the Communists' monopoly on power.</p>
<p>The main parts of the reform program were reducing the number of people
who were arrested or otherwise excluded from society, amnesty for most
political prisoners, cuts in heavy industry and defense industry output,
and improvements in the production of food and consumer products. Not
all of these measures were welcomed by the eastern European party
leaders, whom Khrushchev often ridiculed as "little Stalins." Only one
of them the Soviets managed to curtail straight away: the old Stalinist
Mátyás Rákosi in Hungary. He was already during the Beriia interregnum
forced to share power with Imre Nagy, who had previously been criticized
as a "nationalist deviationist." And even in Hungary the changes were
temporary. By 1955 Rákosi had maneuvered himself back into
power.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en171en">^12^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en171} But
Khrushchev still pushed hard for political changes. He met with the
eastern European leaders and warned them that they faced a catastrophe
if they did not reform. But most eastern European Communists resisted,
concerned that reform would be interpreted by their populations merely
as weakness. They often and correctly explained to a furious Khrushchev
that they had simply implemented orders coming from Moscow before.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-197}In spite of the lack of wholehearted
support for his new course from the eastern European leaders, or perhaps
because of it, Khrushchev and the other Soviet leaders decided to expand
the integration processes in the eastern bloc. The new bosses in the
Kremlin had been watching the rise of western European and NATO
integration closely, and they wanted the same advantages for their
alliances. The result was the setting up of the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as a
countercheck to NATO, and a stepping up of economic coordination through
the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Many eastern European
leaders initially thought these were just new ways of dictating and
controlling them by Moscow. But they soon realized that Khrushchev had
more of a genuine mutual integration in mind. Although he insisted on
the paramountcy of the Soviet Union as the oldest and biggest Communist
state, the new Soviet leader understood that effective military and
economic cooperation would have to involve a bit of give and
take.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en172en">^13^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en172} By the
late 1950s eastern bloc summit meetings no longer just involved the
others being ordered around by the Soviets. Real discussions started to
appear, with a sense of common purpose as well as
disagreements.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en173en">^14^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en173}</p>
<p>The biggest surprise of Khrushchev's early years in power was his 1954
decision to normalize relations with Yugoslavia. Stalin's pet object of
hatred in his final years was the Yugoslav leader Tito, whom Soviet
propaganda referred to as "the stinking head of a fascist clique" and "a
prostitute for Anglo-American
imperialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en174en">^15^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en174}
All eastern European leaders whom Stalin had purged were routinely
called Titoists, in addition to other epithets. At least twice the Boss
had seriously considered invading Yugoslavia. But other priorities had
intervened, and Tito had, reluctantly and in desperation, sought support
from the United States and western Europe, which had kept his regime
afloat. The Yugoslav leader therefore hesitated to respond to Moscow's
overtures, until Khrushchev himself showed up in Belgrade in May 1955 to
apologize in person for Soviet actions. "We studied assiduously the
materials on which had been based the serious accusations and offenses
directed at that time against the leaders of Yugoslavia," he told Tito.
"The facts show that these materials were fabricated by the enemies of
the people[;] detestable agents of imperialism who by deceptive
methods pushed their way into the ranks of our
party."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en175en">^16^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en175}
Khrushchev blamed Beriia. Tito welcomed the visit, but would have none
of it. Stalin himself was to blame, he
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en176en">^17^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en176}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-198}Khrushchev was slowly coming around to the
same position himself, and not only with regard to Yugoslavia. In
February 1955 he had Malenkov, his nearest rival for party power,
demoted from the premiership. In July, after returning from Belgrade, he
attacked Molotov for adhering too closely to Stalin's line. "I will
frankly say," Khrushchev told the Central Committee, "that I believed
Molotov's word on everything, [and] like many of us, thought that he
was a great and experienced diplomat. Sometimes you'd look and then
reason and think: Damn it, maybe I am missing
something!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en177en">^18^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en177}
Molotov was replaced as foreign minister the following year. But in
spite of all this infighting, none of the defeated leaders were
executed, arrested, or even thrown out of the central committee.
Khrushchev had something bigger in sight: a break with the Stalinist
past and a reinvigoration of Lenin's party, thereby shortening the road
to Communism.</p>
<p>His opportunity came at the Communist Party's Twentieth Congress in
February 1956. It was the first such Congress since Stalin's death, and
Stalin had never bothered much with them---there had been no Congress
between 1939 and 1952. Khrushchev had prepared a speech that would stun
the Soviet and foreign Communists assembled there. The speech was held
at the end of the Congress, to a closed session of delegates and
high-ranking party members who had been released from Stalin's prisons.
It was therefore dubbed "the secret speech," but there was little doubt
that Khrushchev expected it to eventually be made public. He got up to
speak just after midnight. "Quite a lot has been said about the cult of
the individual and about its harmful consequences," he began. "The
negative characteristics of Stalin... transformed themselves during the
last years into a grave abuse of power... which caused untold harm to
our party.... Stalin acted not through persuasion, explanation, and
patient cooperation with people, but by imposing his concepts and
demanding absolute submission to his opinion. Whoever opposed this...
was doomed to removal from the leading collective and to subsequent
moral and physical annihilation."</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-199}While the audience gasped in astonishment
and trepidation, Khrushchev continued his indictment. While Stalin had
begun as a servant of the party, he had become a despot, the first
secretary said, who engaged in "the most cruel repression, violating all
norms of revolutionary legality." He spoke of Stalin's intolerance, his
brutality, and his coldheartedness, and pointed out that the majority of
all delegates at the Seventeenth Communist Party Congress, in 1934, had
later been arrested as counterrevolutionaries. Khrushchev listed some of
those who had been unjustly arrested or executed by name. And it had all
been for nothing, Khrushchev argued. Stalin had left the country
woefully unprepared for World War II. The victory in 1945 had been the
people's, the party's, and the Red Army's, not Stalin's.</p>
<p>But Khrushchev's worst indictment was reserved for Stalin's postwar
behavior. Then, the new leader said, "Stalin became even more
capricious, irritable, and brutal; in particular his suspicion grew. His
persecution mania reached unbelievable dimensions. Many workers were
becoming enemies before his very eyes.... Everything was decided by him
alone without any consideration for anyone or anything." The break with
Yugoslavia was Stalin's fault, as were the postwar purges. "You see to
what Stalin's mania for greatness led. He had completely lost
consciousness of reality; he demonstrated his suspicion and haughtiness
not only in relation to individuals in the USSR, but in relation to
whole parties and
nations."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en178en">^19^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en178}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-200}In the audience, some fainted, though the
majority cheered wildly. The Polish party leader Bolesław Bierut had a
heart attack and died when he read the text. Communists everywhere were
profoundly shocked when they heard about the speech. Their whole lives
they had been defending Stalin and the USSR against what they considered
slander. Now their key leader told them, and the whole world, that
Stalin's accusers had been right. Some, in western Europe where they had
the freedom to do so, left the Communist parties. Others rejoiced in the
supposed return to Leninism. Mao Zedong told the Soviet ambassador that
Stalin had always approached the Chinese with "distrust and suspicion."
Stalin had "continued to believe more in the power of the Guomindang
than of the Communist Party," said Mao, adding that he himself had been
treated like a "Chinese
Tito."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en179en">^20^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en179} For Mao,
as for other Communists, some hard questions had to be asked, however,
even if they initially felt relieved by the criticism of Stalin. Where
had the other Soviet leaders, including Khrushchev himself, been while
Stalin had "violated all norms"? And could not the criticism of Stalin
be carried too far, so that the principles of Communist rule---not to
mention their own positions---could be undermined?</p>
<p>In the summer of 1956 the worst fears of the Communist leaders were
confirmed. As so often, it began in Poland. On 28 June around one
hundred thousand workers gathered in the city center of Poznan to demand
lower work quotas, lower food prices, and the freedom to organize
independently of the Communist Party. They were met with brute force by
the Polish army, commanded by the defense minister, Konstantin
Rokossovsky, who up to 1949 had been a general in the Soviet Red Army.
Up to one hundred striking workers were killed, and nearly one thousand
arrested. But the crackdown did little to stem unrest elsewhere in the
country. Most worrying from Moscow's perspective, a number of Polish
Communists joined in the calls for reform and to replace the party's
leadership. Matters came to a head at an 8 October Central Committee
meeting, at which the Communist reformer Władysław Gomułka, recently
released from prison, was elected the head of the Polish Communist
Party. Faced with incidents all over the country in which ordinary
people demanded free elections, religious freedom, and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops, Gomułka promised an end to repression and a more open
society, including talks with the church. He also wanted to remove
Soviet advisers from Poland and increase food subsidies for workers.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-201}Khrushchev was alarmed. On 19 October he
led a top-level delegation from the Soviet party leadership to Warsaw to
discuss matters face to face with Gomułka and the new Polish leadership.
The Soviets attacked the Poles for allowing news stories critical of the
Soviet Union to be published. Gomulłka retorted that the same was
happening in the Soviet Union itself after the Twentieth Congress. "What
frightens them?" Gomułka wrote in his own abbreviated summary of
Khrushchev's reply. "It's not [about] insults, as much as the threat
of us [Polish Communists] losing power. The slogan of the youth: away
with Rakossovsky [<em>sic</em>], is a blow against the army. How are we [the
Soviets] to reconcile [Soviet-Polish] friendship with the demand to
recall officers, Soviet officers. They can't be thrown out all of the
sudden. Do Soviet officers imperil [Polish] sovereignty? If you [the
Poles] consider the Warsaw Pact unnecessary---tell us. Anti-Soviet
propaganda does not meet any
resistance."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en180en">^21^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en180} But
Gomułka would not give in, and both sides realized that an open break
would imperil the position of both. With the situation tense, and with
Polish youth chanting anti-Soviet slogans in the streets, cheering
Gomułka on, the Red Army units in Poland were put on full combat
readiness.</p>
<p>By late October 1956, though, the Soviet leaders found that events in
Poland were much overshadowed by graver circumstances in Hungary. There,
the Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi, who had seen his power circumscribed
on Beriia's orders in 1953, had defeated the reformists and regained his
former authority. After Khrushchev's February speech, the majority in
the Communist Party, supported by Moscow, toppled Rákosi and replaced
him with Ernő Gerő, a party leader no less Stalinist but more to the
Soviets' liking. Independent student clubs had sprung up all over the
country to discuss Hungary's future. But little had happened on the
streets until news came through from Poland that Khrushchev had agreed
to a compromise with Gomułka, in which Soviet advisers would be removed
and more open debate allowed. On 23 October the Hungarian Writers'
Union, joined by some of the student clubs, placed flowers on the
monument to a Polish-Hungarian revolutionary hero from 1848. They
recited a patriotic poem:</p>
<p>::: linegroup
<em>On your feet, Magyar, the homeland calls!</em></p>
<p><em>The time is here, now or never!</em></p>
<p><em>Shall we be slaves or free?</em></p>
<p><em>This is the question, choose your answer!-</em></p>
<p><em>By the God of the Hungarians</em></p>
<p><em>We vow,</em></p>
<p><em>We vow, that we will be slaves</em></p>
<p><em>No longer!<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en181en">^22^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en181}</em>
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-202}As the crowd grew, someone cut the
Communist symbols from a Hungarian flag, and a throng of about twenty
thousand people marched behind the new banner toward the parliament
building. By nightfall they were ten times as many, chanting slogans
against Soviet occupation and for political freedom. When Gerő took to
the radio to condemn the rally, the demonstrators responded by toppling
a large statue of Stalin in downtown Budapest. Another group of
protesters attacked the radio headquarters. State security officers
opened fire on the crowds. The Hungarian revolution had begun.</p>
<p>With the situation out of control in Budapest and many other Hungarian
cities, the Soviet leadership met with eastern European Communist
leaders in the Kremlin. After Gerő had appealed for Red Army
intervention, Soviet troops had already begun to cross the border in the
early morning of 24 October. In Moscow the leaders discussed the
situation, trying to find ways of avoiding an armed conflict. "In the
case of Poland," Khrushchev said, "it is necessary to avoid nervousness
and haste. It is necessary to help the Polish comrades straighten out
the party line and do everything to reinforce the union among Poland,
the USSR, and the other people's democracies." But in the Hungarian case
the situation was extremely serious. Khrushchev still expected that it
could be contained without bloodshed. He said that Communists everywhere
needed to "think about the problems in greater depth. We must realize
that we are not living as we were during the [Comintern], when only
one party was in power. If we wanted to operate by command today, we
would inevitably create chaos.... Ideological work itself will be of no
avail if we do not ensure that living standards rise.... In our country
they also listen to the BBC and Radio Free Europe. But when they have
full stomachs, the listening is not so
bad."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en182en">^23^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en182}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-203}With Soviet support, the Hungarian
Communist Party made Imre Nagy the new prime minister. He was an
unconventional but effective Communist leader who had been purged by the
party several times in the past. But the situation in Budapest and
elsewhere only worsened. A general strike had been declared. Workers'
councils and revolutionary committees took power from local authorities
and took over arms depots and police stations. With orders only to
protect major public institutions, the Red Army was mostly bystanders.
Nagy believed that compromises needed to be made with the protesters,
hoping that they would join with him in seeking peaceful reform. With
this in mind, he extracted several concessions from the Soviets: Red
Army troops would be withdrawn, there would be an amnesty for all
revolutionaries and a legalization of their organizations, and the hated
state security bureau would be dissolved.</p>
<p>But the concessions came too late. The people in Budapest and other
cities had begun to organize their own authorities and armed groups. The
youth, especially, were celebrating their newfound freedom. Some
Hungarian army units began to cross over to the rebel side. After Soviet
troops opened fire on protesters in front of the parliament building,
killing at least one hundred, the mood turned increasingly ugly. There
were pitched battles between Red Army soldiers and Hungarian rebels all
over Budapest, and the civilians fighting to protect their barricades
refused to give in. Nagy was playing for time. He begged the Soviets to
withdraw their troops immediately, saying that he and the Hungarian
Communists would be able to restore order on their own. Khrushchev
wanted to reduce the violence and avoid a full-scale invasion. On 30
October the new Soviet foreign minister, Dmitri Shepilov, who had
replaced the dogmatic Molotov in the summer of 1956, declared that "with
the agreement of the government of Hungary, we are ready to withdraw
troops. We will have to keep up struggle with national-Communism for a
long time."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en183en">^24^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en183}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-204}While the Hungarian and Soviet governments
were negotiating, people were taking power into their own hands all over
Hungary. Revolutionary committees began to administer basic services,
and organized the fighting. The old political parties were
reestablished. Some Communist party headquarters were attacked and set
on fire, and the remaining offices of the security services were raided.
A number of security officers were executed on the spot. Around the
headquarters of the security service in Budapest the fighting was
particularly fierce. When Red Cross personnel tried to evacuate the
wounded, they, too, came under fire from inside the building. Then, a
reporter wrote, the "youngsters took over": "They were magnificent;
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen year old kids. They ran in there with no
protection at all. A kid ran in, half bent over. He put a man on his
back and dragged him to shelter. Now, many were at it. Young boys in
twos, flat on the ground, some pulling stretchers, getting to the
wounded and dragging them back. Nothing could stop
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en184en">^25^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en184}</p>
<p>When the main building of the hated security services was finally
occupied, the revolutionaries showed no mercy: "Six young officers came
out, one very good-looking. Their shoulder boards were torn off. They
wore no hats. They had a quick argument. 'We're not so bad as you think
we are. Give us a chance,' they were saying.... Suddenly one began to
fold[;] they were going down the way you'd cut corn. Very gracefully.
They folded up smoothly, in slow motion. And when they were on the
ground the rebels were still loading lead into
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en185en">^26^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en185}</p>
<p>Reports of the attacks on Communists made the Soviet leaders change
their mind. It became clear to them that Nagy would not be able to
stabilize the situation, and that both the Communist regime in Hungary
and the integrity of the Soviet bloc were waning quickly. The day after
they had decided to withdraw their troops, the Soviets turned around and
ordered a massive military intervention to crush the rebellion.
Khrushchev's rethinking was also fueled by the advice of other eastern
European Communists and the Chinese in favor of an invasion, and by the
NATO powers being distracted by the Suez Crisis, which was unfolding at
the same time. Overall the concrete response of the Americans and the
western Europeans had been limited. For Eisenhower the prospect of
intervening in the Soviet bloc was a nonstarter, even though some
foreign radio stations, such as Radio Free Europe, were encouraging the
Hungarian revolutionaries.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-205}The Soviet invasion forced Nagy to make
the toughest decision of his life. In the end, and in spite of a
checkered career that included a time as a Soviet secret police
informer, he sided with the revolutionaries. His government unilaterally
withdrew Hungary from the Warsaw Pact and declared the country's
neutrality.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en186en">^27^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en186} Nagy
also appealed for UN intervention. It was, of course, to no avail.
Nagy's last broadcast was in the early morning of 4 November: "Today at
daybreak Soviet forces attacked our capital with the obvious intention
of overthrowing the lawful democratic Hungarian government. Our troops
are in combat. The government is at its post. I notify the people of our
country and the entire world of this
fact."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en187en">^28^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en187} Soon
afterward the radio station issued its final appeals for help. Then it
went off air. When it reappeared in the evening it was in the hands of a
new Hungarian government, led by János Kádár, installed by the Soviets.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the crushing of the Hungarian revolution was deeply
depressing for Europeans. It showed that the division of the continent
into power blocs was there to stay. The United States and its allies had
no plans for "liberating" the eastern Europeans, in spite of occasional
rhetoric about the "roll-back of Communism." And Khrushchev's attempts
at liberalization inside and outside the Soviet Union were landed a
heavy blow by his own hands. Two hundred thousand Hungarians fled west,
twenty thousand were arrested, and 230 executed, including Prime
Minister Nagy and several of his close associates. In western Europe, as
a direct result of Hungary, the Communist parties lost strength, some of
them irrevocably. And in the east most opponents of the regimes
concluded that they could not win through open rebellions against
Moscow. Unless international circumstances changed, the road to reform
would have to be gradual.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-206}But the eastern European Communist regimes
also drew lessons from Hungary. Repression would have to be balanced
against real improvements in people's living conditions. Subsidies for
food, housing, and health care had to be stepped up. Any increase in
work quotas had to be avoided, even if it meant borrowing money abroad
to offset low productivity. In Poland Gomułka engaged in much
nationalist rhetoric against a German revanchist threat---centering, of
course, on West Germany and not on the "friendly" East Germany next
door. But he also opened up Polish society so that most people felt
freer than before. In Hungary the new leader, Kádár, initially reviled
as a quisling by most Hungarians, with Soviet consent moved away from
the Stalinist terror of the past. Kádár gradually made his country the
most "liberal" eastern European state, with larger plots of private
land, less state interference, and freer travel than anywhere else. But
neither Gomułka nor Kádár wanted to remove the Communist dictatorship or
the close alliance with the Soviet Union. They may have been cabbage or
goulash Communists, as they were often derided to be. But they remained
Communists all the same.</p>
<p>Nikita Khrushchev survived the Polish and Hungarian events politically,
although by a hairsbreadth. In 1957 he stared down a coup attempt in the
Central Committee, in which most of the old Stalin coterie conspired
against him. It became their, not his, political end. Molotov was packed
off as ambassador to Mongolia. Malenkov and Stalin's old-time associate
Lazar Kaganovich were made factory directors in Kazakhstan and in the
Urals, respectively. In 1961 they were all expelled from the Communist
Party. Khrushchev, in the most symbolic act of his career, had Stalin's
body removed from the mausoleum on Red Square, where it had been laying
next to Lenin, and hastily reburied along the Kremlin wall. The Soviet
leader continued to believe that he could create a new and reformed
Communism, harking back to the Leninist ideals of the past. But Poland
and Hungary had told him that it would have to be without political
reforms that could endanger the whole Communist edifice.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-207}Instead Khrushchev turned to the expansion
of Soviet plans for agriculture, science, and technology. In spite of
its gigantic size, the Soviet Union had always had problems with its
food supply, mainly because its collective farms lacked productivity. It
was also held back by its biologists, who, mainly for ideological
reasons, clung to the teachings of Trofim Lysenko, a Soviet geneticist
who believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Khrushchev
was convinced that bigger and better collective farms would solve the
problem. He proposed to develop "virgin lands" in northern Kazakhstan
and western Siberia to produce more wheat. Beginning in 1954, almost two
million people from the western Soviet Union migrated to the new giant
farms in the east. Some were sent there by the government. Others were
attracted by promises of better wages and living conditions. Yet others
were caught up in the ideological fervor of developing new lands for
Communism and for their country. The tasks they faced were overwhelming.
Within a territory half again as large as California or Sweden, they had
to build successful farms from scratch. Leonid Brezhnev, a young
Communist technocrat from the Ukraine who later became general secretary
of the Soviet Communist Party, described the challenges he and others
faced: "Selection of sites for the centers of the new state farms; the
reception and accommodation of hundreds of thousands of volunteers in
country that was still totally unprepared for human habitation; the
urgent building of tens and later hundreds of state farm settlements;
the selection of many thousands of specialists; the building of
close-knit, harmonious collectives out of a heterogeneous mass of
people; and the actual plowing of the virgin soil and the first spring
sowing. And this had to be done not gradually but all at once,
simultaneously."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en188en">^29^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en188}</p>
<p>The virgin lands campaigns delivered good results at first, but
ultimately failed. The kinds of wheat selected were not suited for the
arid and cold conditions in the new regions. Irrigation plants did not
deliver enough water and infrastructure was slow to develop. Nutrient
depletion withered away the soil. Some areas saw wind erosion create
massive dust bowls. The environmental outcome was grim, with lakes
drained, soil eroded, and mono-cropping inviting weed and pest
infestations. By the 1970s some of the new collective farms looked like
ghost towns, and breadlines returned to the Soviet cities. What remained
of the virgin lands campaign and similar Soviet campaigns in central
Asia, Siberia, the Caucasus, and in Soviet eastern Europe was a mixture
of peoples and cultures, which added to the deportations Stalin had
carried out in creating truly multicultural sites throughout the Soviet
Union. In Kazakhstan there were more Russians than Kazakhs in 1970; in
Turkmenia and in Estonia, only about two-thirds of the population were
Turkmen or Estonians. The rest came from population groups all over the
Soviet Union, though the main part of the migrants tended to be Russian.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter007.xhtml#page-208}But it was not only agriculture that was
supposed to benefit from virgin lands. One of Khrushchev's grander
schemes was the building of a new city for science and technology in
Siberia, Akademgorodok. "We hoped very much that by coming to virgin
lands we could start everything from scratch, according to international
scientific standards, instead of waiting for God-only-knows how long in
Moscow's old established institutions," said a young physicist who
arrived in Akademgorodok in 1961. "We wanted to catch up with the
West."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en189en">^30^</a>{#chapter007.xhtml#en189} And catch
up they did, at least in some fields, as Soviet nuclear science had
already demonstrated. By the late 1950s Soviet electromagnetics,
hydrodynamics, and quantum electronics were as developed as in any other
country, and in some fields, such as space exploration, the Soviets were
pushing ahead. In 1957 they launched the first satellite, Sputnik, which
orbited the earth in 96 minutes, doing 1,500 orbits in all. The feat
elated Soviet leaders and frightened Americans and western Europeans,
who believed that the Communists could weaponize their satellites and
thereby win the Cold War. They tended to forget that a large portion of
the Soviet population could only watch the satellite streaking through
the sky from their place in the breadline or from their derelict
collective farms.

<p>Eastern Europe was remade by Communism, western Europe was remade by
capitalism. In the 1950s and '60s western European countries were
transformed almost beyond recognition by widespread social and economic
change. The pace of the change was dizzying for many. European writers
and novelists, an Albert Camus in France or a Heinrich Böll in Germany,
describe how quickly former lives were left behind. A Norwegian poet saw
a great river that uproots everything and forces it all downstream, into
a wider world. For many western Europeans, that river was the entrance
to a better life: richer and healthier, with better jobs, education, and
social welfare than before. Even those who deplored the loss of the old
were often seen luxuriating in the new: striking French dockworkers
drinking Coca-Cola, British aristocrats enjoying American-style central
heating. The close encounter between the United States and western
Europe set off changes, some of which seemed superficial but which would
nonetheless alter the European continent forever.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the success of the new were the disasters of the
old. After Europe's calamitous half century, <em>any</em> stability would do,
even one that was imposed by outside powers through the Cold War.
Although few Europeans admitted any responsibility for what had gone
wrong, most still realized that continuing the way they had done before
was impossible. While almost everyone wished for a welfare state in
which governments influenced the commanding heights of the economy, most
also believed that private enterprise should play a role in the economy
of the future. Even the Left was divided on that question. The
Communists, of course, wanted a transition to full government ownership
of the means of production, but Socialists, Social-Democrats, and
Labourites may have wanted, at times, to nationalize key services and
industries, but rarely wanted the state to take over the corner store.
All western European countries set out a role for the market in their
economies. But they wanted capitalist <em>successes</em> to help the overall
economy, not failures like in the 1920s and '30s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-210}The rescue of capitalism in western
Europe, and its expansion as integrated markets, was therefore dependent
on a great deal of hybridity. Even more so than in the United States
during Roosevelt's New Deal, European governments wanted market
expansion within clear rules and regulations set by the governments
themselves. And while the New Deal was always presented as an emergency
measure, state-controlled capitalism in Europe was supposed to be a
lasting compromise between state, capital, and labor. Indeed, some of
its power came from that sense of compromise, which was a faculty that
had been lacking in Europe during the past two generations. Both
Christian Democratic and Social Democratic politics had an appeal to
national cooperation and cohesiveness as a core part of their strength.</p>
<p>The role of the United States in all of this was of course central,
though not at all times in ways that its critics or closest supporters
imagined. As we have seen, significant changes had been underway in
Europe itself since the early part of the century, in social mores,
products, and consumption. They had been held back by the unprecedented
misfortunes of 1914 to 1953, from Sarajevo to Seoul, when disasters
always seemed to be right around the corner (and often were). Compared
to the Soviet role in eastern Europe, in western Europe it is much more
difficult to disentangle what was US influence and what would have
happened anyway. Apart from the crucial US role in helping European
elites back on their feet through the Marshall Plan and defending them
from what they and the Americans saw as a clear and distinct Soviet
threat, it is hard to tell what came from within and what came from
without.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-211}The point about the postwar
Americanization of western Europe is therefore less about its
comprehensiveness than its relative suddenness. Processes of integrating
US and European economies had been underway during the interwar period.
But the challenges of the 1930s had held them back. US private
investment in Europe was very limited (and would remain so up to the
1960s). Even though US business methods and products had proliferated in
interwar Europe, knowledge about each other was strikingly deficient,
especially on the European side, where US history or politics were
barely understood. This was especially true in the main European
countries: France, Germany, and Britain. Scandinavians, Greeks, and
Italians, who were more likely to have relatives in the United States,
knew more about the country. Overall it was an important relationship,
but not a close one.</p>
<p>The concept of "The West" was therefore meaningless before the 1950s.
There were plenty of public references to a common heritage: Greece,
Rome, Christianity, and badly disguised remarks about race. But there
were no instruments of cohesion before military, economic, political,
and cultural interaction sped up in the postwar era. These placed the
United States at the center of western Europe's consumer revolution,
through its music, movies, and fashion as much as through its political
ideals. An imagined America made it possible for many western Europeans
to escape from restrictions of class, gender, or religion. The United
States was therefore part of a European revolution that was in many ways
as deep, and more lasting, than the Soviet impact in the eastern half of
the continent.</p>
<p><strong>T[HERE WERE THREE]{.small-caps}</strong> main reasons why the western
European economic transformation sped up in the 1950s. One was simply a
catch-up created by nondevelopment in the past. Europe in 1914 had been
the center of the world economy. Europeans had the desire and most of
the knowledge needed to get back in the economic and technological
forefront. What had held them back was bad politics, which led to
catastrophes on a scale the continent had not known since the
seventeenth century. There was therefore plenty of pent-up demand for
housing, goods, services, and high-quality and stable food supplies.
Production would get going as soon as there were credit and functional
currencies. And the US presence secured both of these preconditions,
fast, through the Marshall Plan, the international financial
institutions, and bilateral agreements.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-212}The United States was also integral to
providing the security needed for the economic transformation to take
place. Although this need was more psychological than real---the USSR
was not planning to attack western Europe---its satisfaction was still
necessary in order to move forward. Too often in the past people had
been told to build things up, only to see them torn down again. What
Europeans needed was confidence in the future, and the US security
presence supplied that, at least for the critical period when the
foundations for European development had to be laid.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the ability to cooperate across lines that had so
often divided Europeans in the past. Some of this came out of sheer
need. With people on the verge of starvation, it was a lot harder to
appeal for strikes and lockouts, especially when governments worked hard
to integrate labor and capital through forms of social compromise. This
was especially true since there was very little leadership for the
substantial minority of western Europeans who distrusted capitalism
altogether. Even the Communist parties had appealed for their supporters
to participate in national reconstruction, and the only way they could
do so was through the political and economic system devised by their
governments. Gradually, the idea and practice of transnational European
integration also began to take hold, providing the critical element that
took western Europe from reconstruction to reemergence.</p>
<p>Not all of it was a success story, of course, even though in light of
the experience of Europe's previous generation it is easy to present it
as such. Cold War conformity meant that dissent was sometimes
suppressed. The past was often swept under the carpet, not only in
Germany and Italy, but also in France, where the crimes of the Vichy
government were overlaid with unifying narratives of heroic resistance.
In Spain and Portugal, which were still under fascist governments, the
past was not even past. There, as elsewhere in western Europe,
minorities faced a harsh assimilation policy, sometimes carried out in
the name of national security. Many women and young people felt that the
demands of reconstruction and economic growth made it even less likely
for them to have a public voice than had even been the case during wars
and depression. And, most important of all, the transformation was
happening only in one half of the continent, which may have made it
simpler to achieve, but also created questions about its overall
long-term significance.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-213}Cold War western Europe was built on two
international pillars. One was military cooperation with the United
States through NATO. The other was economic and political integration
through agreements among western European countries. To some extent
Atlantic and European links went hand in hand. The United States had
been militarily predominant in western Europe since 1944, and as NATO
became more of an integrated military alliance because of the Korean
War, US predominance became institutionalized. Both Americans and
Europeans were careful, however, to set up deliberative bodies that
conveyed the impression of a democratic alliance, in which all members
had an equal say. But, besides security delivered by US military
prowess, the most important European aspects of NATO were the access
that member states had to buy weapons (most often through US credits)
and train their own forces internationally. NATO became a school through
which western European countries gradually, but increasingly, obtained
the sense of a common purpose.</p>
<p>Not all of the military cooperation was plain sailing. One big question
was what to do with West Germany. After the Korean War broke out, the
Americans became increasingly insistent that they wanted West Germany to
re-arm as part of the Western alliance. The Europeans, understandably,
demurred. The plan they devised in 1950 to overcome the problem, the
European Defense Community, which would have integrated German forces
under a common European command, was far too complex to work in
practice. It collapsed in 1954, when the French, whose government had
originally proposed the plan, refused to ratify it. The following year
West Germany joined NATO as a full member.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-214}The other big issue was to how to handle
the command of nuclear weapons in western Europe. By the late 1950s the
Europeans wanted more of a say within NATO over military strategy, and
especially over planning for nuclear warfare. Since 1954, based on the
experience in Korea, NATO decided as part of its doctrine that it could
respond even to a non-nuclear Soviet attack on western Europe by using
nuclear weapons. This was in part general deterrence and in part
recognition of Soviet superiority in conventional forces. Britain had
become a nuclear power in 1952 and France tested its first nuclear
weapon in 1960. Some political leaders, both in western Europe and the
United States, wanted more nuclear cooperation in Europe, in part
because they feared West Germany might also be tempted to develop its
own weapons. Still, a US proposal for a sea-based nuclear Multi-Lateral
Force (MLF), operated and commanded jointly by the United States and
western Europeans, collapsed in 1964. The British and, especially, the
French wanted to keep their nuclear autonomy. Some feared <em>any</em> German
involvement in nuclear matters. As the US singer-comedian Tom Lehrer put
it in his "MLF Lullaby":</p>
<p>::: linegroup
<em>Once all the Germans were warlike and mean,</em></p>
<p><em>But that couldn't happen again.</em></p>
<p><em>We taught them a lesson in nineteen eighteen,</em></p>
<p><em>And they've hardly bothered us since
then.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en190en">^1^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en190}</em>
:::</p>
<p>How to deal with Germany was also at the center of plans for Europe's
economic recovery. By 1950, much helped by the Marshall Plan, the
western European economies seemed to have stabilized, but all of them
were still far from the goal of significant and stable growth. Some
European and American leaders believed that the only way such growth
could be created was by closer European economic integration. One of the
effects of long years of wars and depression was to have broken up the
transnational markets that had helped make Europe rich in the first
place. But given the status of the national economies in western Europe
in the late 1940s, it was unlikely that such markets would reconstitute
themselves, at least anytime soon. So, as with the national economies,
governments set out to organize frameworks within which international
economic cooperation (and competition) could thrive.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-215}The road toward European economic
integration was formed by the coming together of many different paths.
One starting point was the institutions of the Marshall Plan itself, and
especially the Organization for European Economic Cooperation. Set up in
1948 to help administer US assistance across borders, the OEEC also
helped remove quotas on private trade and make currencies convertible.
It also assisted in reducing tariffs and floated the idea of a customs
union, which could lead to a European, or possibly Atlantic, free trade
area. The latter was a step much too far for most western European
politicians in the early 1950s, concerned as they were with balances of
trade and currency restrictions. But combined with the security
emergency of the Korean War and the growth of NATO, which from 1952 also
included Greece and Turkey as members, the OEEC was a starting point for
European integration on a grander scale.</p>
<p>Even more important was the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC),
which was formed by France, West Germany, Italy, and the Low Countries
in 1951. The plan was the brainchild of the former French prime minister
Robert Schuman, who also served as foreign minister from 1948--53. He
and his collaborators designed a supranational authority with control of
a common market in mining and steel production in all the member
countries, which meant mainly in France and Germany. The ECSC was
intended as an alternative to a long-term French occupation of parts of
Germany to harness its industrial potential. Instead, Schuman believed,
all of western Europe could benefit from cooperation between France and
Germany, both in Cold War terms, by increasing and regulating strategic
production, and in terms of economic development. Jean Monnet, the
Frenchman who was the first head of ECSC, also made sure that it had a
social purpose, through subsidies for miners and workers, and that its
institutions pointed toward wider European integration in other fields
as well.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-216}The beginning processes of western
European integration were created by one-third idealism and two-thirds
practical necessity. It was a Cold War project from the very beginning,
seeking to improve western European strategic production and cohesion
while faced with the threat from the east. It also took many of its
models of integration from the United States, where Monnet had spent
several years. At its core it was about Europe's economic recovery,
which its founding fathers believed would be impossible without a high
degree of integration. But it was also an idealistic project, created to
move away from the French-German antagonism that had dominated European
politics at least since 1870. Cold War pressures concentrated the minds
of European policy-makers and made cooperation necessary. The form that
cooperation took, for Schuman, who himself hailed from the Franco-German
border areas, or Monnet, a European federalist since the 1920s, was
determined by their pan-European outlooks. "World peace cannot be
safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the
dangers which threaten it," began Schuman's declaration of 1950: "The
pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the
setting up of common foundations for economic development.... The
solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any
war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but
materially impossible.... This proposal will lead to the realization of
the first concrete foundation of a European federation indispensable to
the preservation of
peace."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en191en">^2^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en191}</p>
<p>Although most western European leaders had reservations about the
concept of a full European federation, a majority of them, especially
among Christian Democrats, agreed that the ECSC created a foundation to
build on. Even Winston Churchill, back as British prime minister after
the 1950 elections, had called for a "United States of Europe," though
he had doubted that the British Commonwealth would be part of it. In
1956 a committee under Belgian foreign minister Paul-Henri Spaak set out
proposals for what a year later became the Treaty of Rome, creating the
European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC built directly on the ECSC.
It had the same member states and the same supranational approach to
economic integration. But it had a much wider remit, and would, over the
generation that followed, remake western Europe as a unifying economic
zone.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-217}The biggest Cold War problem inside
western Europe was how to handle the German question. From the setting
up of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, there had always been a
suspicion that West German leaders would give up on Western cohesion in
order to strike a deal with the USSR on reunification. The idea was not
far-fetched. Mistrust of Germans, any Germans, went together with the
knowledge that under Cold War conditions such a deal was the only means
through which the Germans could achieve what other Europeans assumed
were their most cherished aims. But the assumption of German pliability
toward the Soviets foundered on the thinking of the West German
<em>Bundeskanzler</em> (premier) Konrad Adenauer. A conservative Christian
Democrat from Rhineland in the west of the country, Adenauer wanted
reunification, but he wanted his Germany's integration with the Western
powers even more. Adenauer was keenly aware of how enticing the siren
song of reunification, even under Communist conditions, could be to some
of his countrymen. He therefore at all times prioritized cooperation
with the French and with the Americans. "For us, there is no doubt that
we belong to the western European world through heritage and
temperament," he had said already in his first declaration as German
premier.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en192en">^3^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en192} And
Adenauer became a constant in West German politics, remaining chancellor
until 1963, when he was eighty-seven years old.</p>
<p>But what really gave credence, to Germans and other Europeans alike, to
Adenauer's <em>Westbindung</em> (attachment to the West), was the extraordinary
recovery of the West German economy that started around 1950. The
<em>Wirtschaftswunder</em>, the German economic miracle, had many causes.
Marshall Plan assistance and the linking of the deutschmark to the US
dollar was one. The gradual integration of the West German economy into
a western European framework was another. Perhaps most important was the
US decision to shield the Federal Republic of Germany from the full
effect of wartime debt and postwar reparations. The FRG had to pay some
reparations, and the dismantling of some German industries and
compensatory takeover of patents and technology continued until the
early 1950s. But the cumulative burden of excessive debt never came into
play. As a result, West Germany was even freer than some of its new
Western partners to plan for further expansion as its economy began to
grow.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-218}The social transformation the
Wirtschaftswunder created was one of the biggest stories of postwar
Europe. In 1945 all of Germany was a bombed-out disaster zone. Ten years
later most people had jobs that paid well enough for their families both
to consume and to save. Industries and infrastructure were approaching
prewar levels. Housing was being rebuilt at astonishing rates. West
German banks had credit available and the country's currency and
interest rates were stable. The West German economy grew by more than 5
percent year on year during the 1950s and '60s. It was the highest
growth rate of any major European economy, more than twice that of
Britain, for instance.</p>
<p>While structural causes explain the fundamentals of West Germany's Cold
War economic expansion, it was the psychological effects of the
Wirtschaftswunder that ensured its amplification and perpetuation. It
was more than a generation since Germans had last been able to believe
that their own work was translatable into wealth, happiness, and
stability for their families. In the 1950s, as they sensed this was at
last becoming possible, they threw themselves into production with a
vengeance. West Germans worked longer hours than most Europeans, and
productivity expanded rapidly. As a result, their purchasing power
almost doubled from 1950 to 1960, and the rapid expansion continued into
the 1960s.</p>
<p>But Germany was not the only western European country that saw high
growth rates in the 1950s and '60s. France, in spite of the political
instability of the Fourth Republic, had substantial growth, as did the
Benelux countries and Scandinavia. The economic expansion in Italy was
very strong, though unevenly spread in terms of rewards, both
geographically and socially. Overall the effect of the economic
transformation of western Europe was not just to rescue capitalism,
which had seemed to be the issue in the 1940s, but to dramatically
expand it as part of people's lives. As industrialization and
urbanization continued, more people were drawn into economic exchanges
as workers and consumers. In 1950, a third of all Frenchmen worked the
land. Twenty years later it was less than 10 percent. But, different
from the late nineteenth-century wave of industrialization, there was
little political radicalization. The French Communist Party lost a third
of its voters during the two first postwar decades.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-219}There were several reasons why Communism
lost out as a political alternative in western Europe. Members of the
Communist parties were persecuted both at work and in society as the
Cold War intensified. When the crimes of Stalin and his cohort became
universally known, and especially after the 1956 uprising in Hungary,
the parties started to lose members. Except in Italy, where domestic
inequity made up for foreign tumults, Communism was not such an
attractive alternative anymore in democratic states. But the main reason
for the crisis in European Communism was not so much political as
social. As many western European countries began dramatically expanding
social welfare for their citizens, the need for revolution seemed ever
less obvious to most of the working class.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the origins of the European welfare state goes back to
the ideological conflicts of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century. But its main expansion was in the 1950s and '60s. For some,
including European and Soviet Communists, this was a surprising
development, given the US predominance in western Europe. They had
interpreted the Marshall Plan as an attempt at Americanizing the
European economies, both for the benefit of US business interests and in
order to push free market solutions. Instead, what western Europe got,
mostly with US blessing, was state-centered solutions, in which
government regulations determined the shape of the national economies.
Western Europe's postwar decades of rapid economic growth were created
in an environment of state control.</p>
<p>The main reasons this was possible were the Cold War emergency and the
lessons of the immediate past. The Cold War, both domestically in
western Europe and between East and West, mandated centralized states in
which quick decisions could be made for the defense of the established
political order. But it also demanded that the powerful western European
working classes could be bought off from industrial unrest and
independent political activism through guarantees for social progress.
Christian Democrats and Social Democrats agreed that part of the reason
for the continent's hitherto unhappy century was the past inability to
integrate the working class into the body politic. Now firmly in power,
they believed that the only way this deficiency could be remedied was
through social programs that gave workers a stake in the nation. While
Christian Democratic parties were closer to the national elites than
Social Democrats were, at least to begin with, they both ended up
putting in place large-scale social security programs, as well as
government-mandated, branch-wise bargaining over wages and working
conditions in industry. Limitations to the workweek, paid vacations, and
regularized pensions all came out of state-imposed initiatives, as did,
somewhat later, comprehensive medical and disability insurance.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-220}US support for such government-centered
development plans can also be explained by the Truman Administration's
realization of just how bad the situation had been all over Europe in
the 1940s. If the choice was between chaos, opening up for Soviet
subversion, and government-imposed order, it was not difficult to make,
for Truman in Europe or for later US administrations elsewhere in the
world, in spite of American ideological predilections. Many US
representatives in postwar Europe (as well as in postwar Japan) had
backgrounds in the United States' own experiments with state-led
initiatives during the New Deal. Granted, western European initiatives
went much further toward state planning than anything implemented
long-term in the United States. But, even so, Americans were not wholly
unused to measures through which the state regulated economic activity.
And in western Europe, for the time being, these controls made sense:
limiting private profit helped secure necessary reinvestment. Providing
welfare prevented political radicalization. And economic pluralism
within the NATO alliance meant that US predominance became less visible,
and therefore probably more effective.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-221}US predominance was visible, and
increasingly so, within the consumer revolution that accompanied western
European economic growth. It was not so much that the products Europeans
desired were always made in the United States. They were often produced
at home or, increasingly, in Japan. But the goods and the marketing that
sold them were often American in origin. For many Europeans, the United
States appeared to be a highly desirable society, affluent and abundant,
and always one step ahead of old-fashioned and restrictive Europe. This
positive view of America seemed to increase the more Europeans got to
know about the country. The expansion of transatlantic travel was
important in that regard, as were plentiful US information agencies and
scholarships.</p>
<p>Even more important was American influence in Europe through its music,
movies, and fashion. Unlike the Soviet efforts at gaining a cultural
influence, there was little that was centrally planned about this. The
State Department and the CIA tried to make sure that "healthy" American
films and literature were spread abroad, but their successes were
limited. Instead, company marketing and consumer responses ruled the
roost. The ability of US film studios and record producers to make their
output inexpensive and plentiful, while Europe suffered all kinds of
shortages, also gave imports an advantage. In 1947, for instance, only
forty French films were made, while 340 were imported from the United
States. Though the music of Elvis Presley or the movies of Marlon Brando
or James Dean were not set up to be propaganda for the American way of
life, young Europeans liked them, in part because of their
rebelliousness. Wearing T-shirts and blue jeans merged a form of protest
against convention with identifying with US movies. In the mid-1950s,
American and European teenagers were more united by Brando than by NATO.</p>
<p>Where US officialdom had more of an influence was in terms of support
for European organizations and institutions. Encouraged by the
government, American philanthropy, such as the Ford or Rockefeller
foundations, gave grants that remade many western European universities
and research centers. The CIA provided funding for organizations such as
the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was set up to combat Communist
influence among writers and artists. And government-backed links with
American labor unions, to the greatest extent the AFL/CIO, helped
convince some European Social Democrats that US society was less
Right-wing and antilabor than what they had imagined. Even so,
unofficial cultural links were more important than anything governments
did to further US soft power in western Europe during the Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-222}Changes for the European world seemed to
come from all sides during the postwar era. Besides the ideological
division of the continent and the increase in US influence, the gradual
loss of its overseas colonies transformed western Europe. In 1945
Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands all
claimed substantial overseas possessions. Around three times as many
people lived in the European colonies as lived in western Europe itself.
By 1965, except for those of Portugal, there were very few colonies
left. The readjustment needed to facilitate this transition inside
Europe---economically and perceptually---was considerable. One issue was
to accommodate Europeans who returned from former colonies, or
populations from the colonies who chose to remain in the metropole.
Another was getting used to the much reduced global status of their own
countries. For Britain and for France, especially, this was a tough
transition. But keeping up the pretensions of being Great Powers
demanded more than these countries could afford. "There is no way that
we will take the path of least resistance and allow France to fade
away," General de Gaulle told his countrymen in
1963.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en193en">^4^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en193} In terms of
world power, however, fading away is a pretty accurate description of
the role of the former empires during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Besides the situation within the continent itself, the changes in the
global economy in the mid-twentieth century also assigned Europe to a
secondary role. In 1950 the United States was the hegemon of world
capitalism. It produced around a third of the combined global economic
output. The US dollar was the only currency used for large international
transactions. The capital that went into international banks was mainly
from the United States. US industries were substantially more
technologically advanced and productive than those in Europe. And
Americans, on average, lived longer and better lives than Europeans, in
spite of the postwar western European recovery.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-223}This unique position of the United States
came about in a world that was primarily based on managed trade and
investment. Governments set quotas and tariffs, regulated capital flows
and currency levels, and decided how national incomes were to be spent.
Successive US administrations pushed for trade and investment
liberalization, but were careful with pushing too hard for fear that
such US pressure could complicate Washington's building of Cold War
alliances with other capitalist countries. The United States therefore
was at the center of a global capitalist economy that had to be managed
for Cold War purposes. The reconstruction of this economic system was in
the US interest, even if that meant putting aside a few of the most
immediate opportunities that existed for Americans making profits
overseas. The hegemonic moment for the United States was circumscribed
by Cold War contingencies that spread all over the world, among which
links with western Europe were central but not always decisive.</p>
<p>Successive US administrations believed that western European integration
was in the American interest. They assisted in the recovery of the
economy and strengthened the European commitment to other multilateral
institutions, first and foremost NATO. The Americans were never overly
concerned that a more united Europe would become a competitor to the
United States. In the 1950s that did not seem likely to happen anytime
soon. And the improvement in common security that came with European
economic growth was more important anyway than narrow US self-interest,
at least in the short run. If western Europe got richer by building
large and integrated markets after American models, that was a good
thing for everyone concerned. As John Foster Dulles, soon to become US
secretary of state, had declared in 1948, "a healthy Europe" could not
be "divided into small compartments." It had to be organized into a
market "big enough to justify modern methods of cheap production for
mass
consumption."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en194en">^5^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en194}</p>
<p>If Europeans hungered for recovery, Americans longed for stability. For
more than twenty years, US voters had faced one emergency after another:
the Great Depression, the New Deal, wars in Europe and Asia, and the
Cold War. In 1952 they voted for stability and normality under General
Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first professional military man to head the US
government since Ulysses S. Grant in the 1870s and the first Republican
president since the onset of the national crises. Eisenhower was an
internationalist and a Cold Warrior who believed that the United States
needed to confront the USSR and Communism worldwide. In his campaign, he
had argued for the need to win in Korea and for "rolling back" Communism
in Europe and Asia. But his main rhetoric was intended to assure
Americans that they were safe under his leadership, and that the United
States would defeat its enemies if it put its own house in order through
national unity, fiscal discipline, a strong defense, and clear
international priorities.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-224}Intent to move away from the Cold War as a
national emergency, Eisenhower ended up institutionalizing it as policy
and doctrine. On the Korean War, the new president simply got lucky.
Stalin's death removed the last hindrance for a negotiated armistice.
But Eisenhower believed that projections of US strength would prevent
what he saw as Soviet adventurism in the future. Confirming Truman's
overall containment strategy, Eisenhower wanted to reinforce it by
increasing US nuclear capacity and readiness. He also upgraded the CIA's
covert operations and used them to overthrow governments the president
saw as inimical to US Cold War interests, such as in Iran in 1953 and in
Guatemala the following year. Eisenhower saw the Cold War as a total
contest that would last for a long time, and in which US purpose and
readiness would remain the critical element.</p>
<p>But the new president also believed, firmly, that the United States
could fight the Cold War without making too many compromises with regard
to its domestic affairs. A fiscal conservative, Eisenhower preferred
developing nuclear deterrents as a less expensive alternative to large
standing armies and massive amounts of conventional weapons. As Dulles
explained in January 1954, "We want for ourselves and for others a
maximum deterrent at a bearable cost": "Local defense will always be
important. But there is no local defense which alone will contain the
mighty land power of the Communist world. Local defenses must be
reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.... The
way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and able
to respond vigorously at places and with means of its own
choosing."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en195en">^6^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en195}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-225}The turn toward a policy of massive
nuclear retaliation meant preparing for strategic warfare on a scale
that so far had seemed unimaginable. Eisenhower set in motion a dramatic
buildup of US atomic capabilities, in what he called his New Look
policy. On his watch, the United States developed intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs). The Pentagon also initiated large-scale intelligence-gathering
programs, including secret overflights of Soviet territory, to gather
information on targeting and enemy capabilities. In addition, the
administration stepped up the deployment of tactical and medium-range
nuclear missiles to US bases in Europe and Asia. When criticized for the
inflexibility of the US strategic stance, the president responded that
the United States had effectively deterred any Soviet attack on itself
or its allies. Eisenhower had no doubt that the US capacity to wage
nuclear warfare against the Soviets vastly outmeasured anything they
could do against the United States. His New Look policy enabled him to
get deterrence on the cheap and without, the president hoped, too much
of a militarization of US society.</p>
<p>Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower feared the political consequences
of making his country into a garrison state, with its budgets geared
toward military procurement and its politics dominated by foreign
threats. After having been supported by Senator McCarthy in the election
campaign, Eisenhower turned on him when the senator in 1954 expanded his
attacks on subservience to Communism in the US Army. The president was
"very mad and getting fed up---it is his Army and he doesn't like
McCarthy's tactics at
all."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en196en">^7^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en196} By the end
of the year McCarthy had been censured by the Senate and removed as a
force in US politics.</p>
<p>The censure of McCarthy removed the foremost symbol of the hysterical
style of Cold War politics in the United States, though it did little to
damage the anti-Communist cause. McCarthy had already become an
embarrassment across the spectrum of American politics. What remained
after him was still a sense of mission on a global scale, on behalf of
democracy, religion, and free markets. Confronting Communism was for
most Americans in the 1950s part of their country's fundamental quality,
and a campaign that had to be won at home and abroad. A very wide
consensus, comprising people who would call themselves either liberals
or conservatives (a distinct minority), was in favor of fighting the
Cold War as part of an American undertaking to improve global affairs.
The Communists, so the thinking went, were trying to take over a world
that by natural direction and God-given foresight was the Americans' to
modernize and make better. The Cold War was therefore an unprecedented
struggle for the soul of mankind.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-226}For many Americans, the need to fight the
Cold War abroad was allied with a sense of achievement at home. Economic
conditions were improving, as were salaries, housing, and access to
consumer goods. The middle class expanded rapidly, and more and more
people moved out of the cities to new houses in the suburbs. Political
leaders from both parties portrayed the fight against Communism as the
defense of all that Americans had achieved materially, socially, and
politically. Religion played an important role in Cold War rhetoric.
Communism was portrayed as God-less radicalism, and clergy and religious
activists who had been persecuted in eastern Europe were often brought
over to the United States to bear witness to what was going on behind
the Iron Curtain. A large majority of Americans believed that their
families and their communities were under direct threat from Communist
subversion in the United States, although not many of them could think
of specific instances when such things had actually happened. Given that
the Communist Party of the United States by the mid-1950s was reduced to
only around five thousand active members, the chances of ever meeting
one of them was indeed limited.</p>
<p>The stability, predictability, and caution that characterized
Eisenhower's America did not suit all Americans. Some felt, rightly,
that they were excluded both from economic and social progress.
African-Americans had been discriminated against ever since slavery was
abolished, and neither the New Deal nor the prosperity of the 1950s did
much to improve their lot. As the civil rights movement expanded, more
and more people drew unfavorable comparisons between American campaigns
for freedom worldwide and the obvious oppression of African-Americans
and other people of color at home. Roy Wilkins, the director of the main
civil rights organization, the NAACP, put it charitably, but well, when
he characterized the president as "a fine general and a good, decent
man, but if he had fought World War II the way he fought for civil
rights, we would all be speaking German
today."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en197en">^8^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en197} Diplomats
from the new African states, who were subject to racial harassment and
segregation in Washington and across the country, were less charitable
in their reports back home.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-227}Another group that benefitted little from
Eisenhower's Cold War America were women who wanted to construct their
own lives outside the confines of family and housework. During the war
many women had found rewarding jobs in industry and services. But the
emphasis on family values and child-rearing during the Cold War had
forced a large number out of the workplace and back to primary roles as
wives and mothers. Some women found the conformity of American society
during the 1950s stifling. Toward the end of the decade both female
employment rates and women's participation in organizations and in
politics had begun to increase. But the biggest breakthrough came in
1960, when the contraceptive pill became widely available. Access to
effective birth control, decided on by women themselves, transformed
family life in Cold War America, and would gradually open up for a much
more active participation in society. But social conservatives condemned
the effects the pill had on population numbers and on young people's
sexual behavior. Christian preachers, both Catholics and Evangelicals,
claimed that birth control was the work of the Devil, alongside
Communism, "free love," and homosexuality.</p>
<p>The 1950s emphasis on material well-being and social conformity led to a
fair amount of restlessness, not just among disadvantaged groups. Many
young people were wondering if they could do more and experience more
than what was visible on the path that their parent's generation had
laid out for them. The unease was both political and cultural. Tastes in
music, movies, literature, and fashion became more daring as the decade
wore on. Some people wondered if they could do more for their country,
including help fight the Cold War more effectively. Many liberals feared
that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in the
international competition for hearts and minds. The Cold War had after
all been as much, if not more, of a liberal political project than a
conservative one. A young Democratic senator from Massachusetts, John F.
Kennedy, in 1958 claimed that President Eisenhower was more preoccupied
with balancing the budget than defeating the USSR. As a result, Soviet
military strength was overtaking that of the United States, creating "a
peril more deadly than any wartime danger we have ever
known."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en198en">^9^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en198} The
president dismissed Senator Kennedy as an inexperienced political
opportunist.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-228}Eisenhower has rightly been praised for
moving the United States away from the political hysteria of the early
Cold War. But if the president was not a Cold War hysteric, neither was
he someone who could conceive of a world without the confrontation with
the Soviet Union. Eisenhower lacked the imagination and the political
will to think about ending the Cold War after Stalin's death. When the
new Soviet leaders attempted to normalize their relations with the West,
through ending the Korean War, reducing their troop levels in Europe,
and talking about peaceful coexistence, the US president hesitated. John
Foster Dulles and his brother, the CIA director Allen Dulles, believed
that Khrushchev's charm offensive was just that: an attempt at getting
the West to lower its guard while the Soviets increased subversion
worldwide. Given the strength of anti-Communism at home, not least in
his own party, Eisenhower did not want to risk useless meetings with the
Soviets. Even the old Cold Warrior Winston Churchill encouraged the
president to extend a hand to the Soviets. "Would it not be well," he
asked Eisenhower in April 1953, "to combine the re-assertions of your
and our inflexible resolves with some balancing expression of hope that
we have entered upon a new era. A new hope has I feel been created in
the unhappy bewildered world. It ought to be possible to proclaim our
unflinching determination to resist communist tyranny and aggression and
at the same time though separately to declare how glad we should be if
we found there was a real change of heart and not let it be said that we
had closed the door upon
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en199en">^10^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en199} But
Eisenhower did not believe the motives of the Soviet leaders had changed
much, and resisted any pressure for a summit meeting until mid-1955.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-229}The 1955 Geneva discussion among the
leaders of the wartime alliance was the first such meeting since 1945.
Eisenhower had agreed to the summit because of Soviet willingness to
support both a settlement in Indochina and the reunification of Austria,
which had been divided into occupation zones since World War II. Though
the conversations were civil, no major breakthroughs were had. The
Americans concluded, somewhat correctly, that the power struggle among
Soviet leaders after Stalin was still ongoing. When meeting with the
Soviet premier, Nikolai Bulganin, President Eisenhower "raised the
question of the satellite [states]": "He explained that there were
literally millions of Americans who had their roots and origins in
Central Europe. The status of the satellites was a matter of very
genuine concern to him. This was not a question on which we could be
silent. Bulganin indicated that it was a subject which it would do no
good to pursue at this conference: it would require time and an
improvement in the
atmosphere."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en200en">^11^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en200}</p>
<p>The Hungarian revolution at the start of Eisenhower's second term led to
a severe setback in East/West relations. It was not until the end of his
presidency that Eisenhower began thinking about possible changes in his
Soviet policy. In his 1959 State of the Union address he spoke at length
about strengthening the institutions of peace, and the following year,
his last as president, Eisenhower agreed to a summit meeting with
Khrushchev in Paris in May. The purpose of the conference was to discuss
a reduction of tension in Europe, and predominantly the German issue.
Eisenhower also hoped that by setting the summit in Paris, he could help
bring the mercurial de Gaulle, now back as president of France, into a
united NATO approach to the Soviets on European security problems. With
some of his closest advisers, Eisenhower had begun to prepare a more
positive response to Soviet proposals of a ban on testing new types of
nuclear weapons. The president may have hoped for a breakthrough in
these negotiations in Paris.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter008.xhtml#page-230}If so, Eisenhower never got the chance to
test Soviet intentions. On 1 May 1960, the Soviet air force shot down an
American U-2 spy plane, which had been traversing the USSR on its way
from Peshawar in Pakistan to Bodø in Norway. Khrushchev was furious. But
the Soviet leader also knew how to play to the gallery. While the
Americans, awkwardly, were trying to lie about it being a meteorological
mission gone wrong, the Soviets put the pilot, who had been rescued, on
show in Moscow. Gary Powers admitted he had been on an espionage flight
for the CIA. Khrushchev relished the propaganda bonanza. But he could
not make up his mind about cancelling the Paris summit, which began two
weeks later. In the end Khrushchev flew to Paris, but under pressure
from party hardliners, he at the last minute refused to meet Eisenhower.
Already under fire from the Chinese for being weak on imperialism, the
Soviet leader could not risk having a summit meeting under these
circumstances.</p>
<p>China and Asia were very much on the minds of leaders both in the USSR
and the United States as Eisenhower's presidency drew to a close. The US
president felt that he had solidified the West and given it a common
purpose on which to confront the Soviet Union and its allies. But he was
much less certain about US positions in Asia. The president feared the
expanding power of China, and believed Beijing would attempt to spread
Communism to Southeast Asia. "If the Communists establish a strong
position in Laos, the West is finished in the whole southeast Asian
area," Eisenhower told his chief advisers just before stepping
down.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en201en">^12^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en201} He gave
little credence to reports of a fundamental and lasting Sino-Soviet
split. The Cold War in Asia "is like playing poker with tough stakes
and... there is no easy solution," the president told his successor,
John F. Kennedy, when he met him at the White House in January
1961.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en202en">^13^</a>{#chapter008.xhtml#en202} Eisenhower

<p>There is a strange symmetry to China's twentieth century, and much of it
is linked to the ideological Cold War. At the beginning of the century,
China's republican revolution was overtaken by Communism and conflict.
And at the end of the century, Communism was overtaken by money and
markets. In between lay a terrible time of destruction and
reconstruction, of enthusiasm and cynicism, and of almost never-ending
rivers of blood. What marks these Chinese revolutions most of all is
their bloodthirst: according to a recent estimate, seventy-seven million
Chinese died unnatural deaths as a result of warfare or political
mass-murder between the 1920s and the 1980s, and the vast majority of
them were killed by other
Chinese.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en204en">^1^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en204}</p>
<p>The People's Republic of China (PRC), the Communist state that Mao
Zedong and his party set up in 1949, had promised peace and development
as its main aims. Instead they took their countrymen almost immediately
into a new war in Korea, in which it suffered at least eight hundred
thousand casualties. By the summer of 1953, when the Korean war ended,
China was an exhausted country, which had to face up to a massive task
of reconstruction after almost twenty years of continuous warfare. The
Chinese leadership had decided that the Soviet Union was to be its
model. It was firmly convinced that the future on a global scale
belonged to socialism, and that China's close alliance with the Soviets
would help put their country at the forefront of world progress. Mao and
his comrades were of course also convinced that Moscow's military
assistance helped them protect their revolution against rapacious US
imperialists. The Korean War had proven that to them, even though they
had not always been satisfied with the level of Soviet support during
the fighting. After all, Mao pointed out, the Chinese were doing the
fighting and dying on behalf of the socialist bloc, including the North
Koreans and the Soviets themselves.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-234}Communism was to be China's weapon for
modernization, according to the party's propaganda. It would make the
country rich and strong. But Mao's agenda went further than the creation
of a modern, wealthy country. He wanted to transform Chinese society and
people's ways of thinking. It was "old China" that was to blame for the
country's weakness, Mao thought, more than even British, Japanese, or
American imperialists. He liked to compare traditional, Confucian forms
of thinking to women with bound feet, hobbling along while being
disdained by others. His "new China," on the other hand, should be
youthful, progressive, and militant. Those who stood in the way were
"pests" to be exterminated; landlords, priests, and capitalists were
holding China back on purpose, in order to serve their own interests.
They had to go, as did all those forces that blocked the new society the
Communists would create. For Mao this was a millennial struggle. It was
China's last chance to redeem itself and retake its rightful position in
the world.</p>
<p>At first, in the 1950s, Chairman Mao and his leadership group believed
that China's progress could only come within the Soviet-led community of
Communist states. But by the latter part of the decade, doubts had set
in. Soviet-style development seemed all too slow for Mao. He wanted to
see China excel in his own lifetime. After 1956, the Chairman believed
for a while that Khrushchev's attempts at reforming the Soviet bloc and
making it more equal and diverse could satisfy China's needs. But Soviet
criticism of China's fast-forward development plans disabused him of
such notions. Amid conflicts over domestic development as well as
international affairs, the Sino-Soviet alliance floundered. By the early
1960s the concept of "brother states" was gone, to be replaced with an
enmity so deep that it almost led to war at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Most of the 1960s saw China alone, internationally isolated and
descending into ever deeper political campaigns to satisfy Mao's thirst
for societal transformation. Economic progress suffered. The Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution, proclaimed by Mao in 1966, made
politics the judge of all things. "It is better to be Red than to be an
expert," was one of its slogans. The result was a chaotic society, in
which violence and dislocation were rife. By the end of their second
decade in power, the Chinese Communists presided over a country that
appeared on the verge of civil war. China's entry into the Cold War
seemed to deliver the opposite of what most Chinese had expected.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-235}<strong>T[HE]{.small-caps}
C[HINESE]{.small-caps} C[OMMUNIST]{.small-caps}</strong> Party (CCP) had been a
war-fighting organization for most of its life span. Although it had
begun to get some experience in civilian administration as it took over
territory during the 1946--50 civil war, it was very unprepared to
preside over a complex society with more than six hundred million
inhabitants, at least sixty ethnic groups, and a geography that spanned
from a dry and cold north to a subtropical south. The Communists had not
administered a city until they took Harbin, up by the Soviet border, in
1946, and they were deeply distrustful of places like Shanghai, Wuhan,
or Guangzhou---cosmopolitan cities where the Communists, who had been
based in the countryside for a generation, had little influence. Some
CCP members were so disgusted with the filth---physical and moral---they
found in Shanghai when they conquered the city in 1949 that they wanted
to abolish it and herd the population into the countryside where they
could reform through hard menial labor. Mao in the end decided against
such excesses; he wanted to use the cities as showcases for the
transformational power of Chinese Communism.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong was sixty years old when the Korean War ended. He reckoned
that he had ten more years to influence China, and he wanted progress
fast. By 1953 Mao had fully embraced the principles of centralized and
structured planning, Soviet-style, that his main colleagues Liu Shaoqi
and Zhou Enlai stood for, and was happy to let younger, Soviet-educated
experts run the day-to-day aspects of the economy. Though a
perfectionist in military campaigning, in peacetime, Mao was never much
of a details man. But he did want to impress on younger comrades his
concerns about time running out. China needed to catch up with the West,
and thereby become a more useful partner of the other Communist
countries. Although he mostly refrained from saying it aloud, Mao felt
that China should become a leader among Communist parties and countries,
and be the closest partner of the Soviet Union itself. After Stalin's
death, he was the most senior Communist leader around. But China, and he
himself, had to earn such a position, Mao thought. A rapid socialist
transformation would be the best proof of China's dedication to the
cause.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-236}The Chinese Communists would have to begin
in the cities. Although in charge of a peasant-based army, Mao had never
doubted that his party would become a proletarian one as the Chinese
working class matured. Now, all of a sudden, the Communists found
themselves in charge of cities in which they had very little
organization among workers. Like in eastern Europe, some of these
workers had taken power for themselves in their factories as war and
civil war came to a close. The Communists faced the double task of
restoring industrial production and organizing workers in Communist-led
trade unions. The strategy they chose, much influenced by their Soviet
advisers, was one that combined cajoling and pressure with promises of
material rewards for workers as soon as industrial production got going
again. All industry had to adhere to the national plan, and the party
appointed managers and directors. In cases where the owners had fled or
were suspected of having been in league with Japan or Chiang Kai-shek,
plants were confiscated by the state. But planning was more important
than ownership in the early People's Republic. It took up to the late
1950s before all industry was nationalized.</p>
<p>In their campaigns in the cities, the CCP was much helped by the
enthusiasm of many young, urban, middle-class Chinese. Though some of
them had joined the party already during the civil war, most had not,
and were now eager to make up for that by showing their patriotism and
dedication to the Communist cause. They were at the forefront of
campaigns dealing with public health, sanitation, or education, or in
the party's crusades against social vice such as prostitution, drug use,
or gambling. Together with those who had been trained in the party's
base areas during the war, these young educated Chinese staffed the PRC
government departments and institutions. While more senior cadres stood
for purges, arrests, or executions, the young adherents showed off the
romantic side of Communism, with their nationalist-infused enthusiasm
for reform and reconstruction.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-237}The rapid transformation of China in the
1950s would not have been possible without Soviet aid. The Soviet
assistance program for China was not only the biggest Moscow ever
undertook outside its own borders. It was also, in relative terms, the
biggest such program undertaken by any country anywhere, including the
US Marshall Plan for Europe. The total from 1946 to 1960 amounted to
around \$25 billion in today's prices, a little bit less than 1 percent
of the Soviet GDP yearly. But in reality the costs were much higher than
this. The sum does not include technology transfers, salaries for Soviet
experts in China, or stipends for Chinese students in the USSR. Even if
we subtract the roughly 18 percent that came from Soviet allies and
around 15 percent that the Chinese eventually paid back, we are still
dealing with a program so vast in scope that it had a major impact on
both countries.</p>
<p>Even though the first agreements for Soviet aid to the CCP were formed
during the Chinese civil war, it was Nikita Khrushchev who really
cranked the program up to its unprecedented size. To Khrushchev,
Stalin's unwillingness to form a closer relationship with the Chinese
was a sign of the old boss's increasing madness. Khrushchev himself saw
unlimited opportunity. The alliance of the world's biggest country with
the most populous one would propel Communism to global victory, he
thought. The potential for cooperation in terms of resources and human
talent was boundless. And China could be transformed in the Communist,
meaning the Soviet, image, by the free will of its own leaders and its
own people. It was an occasion far too good to pass up for Khrushchev.</p>
<p>It was not surprising, then, that the new Soviet leader's first foreign
visit in 1954 was to Beijing. The Chinese capital, into which the
famously rustic Mao had reluctantly moved after the Communist victory,
was made to look its best in preparation for its prominent guest. To
Mao, it was important that Khrushchev had chosen China as his first
destination. It was also important that the Soviet leader came to see
him, rather than the other way around, as had been the case four years
earlier under Stalin's rule. But even more significant were the gifts
Khrushchev had chosen to bring along. He promised a steep increase in
Soviet aid to China, both civilian and military. One-third of all
projects under the first Chinese Five Year Plan were to be built and
paid for by Soviet or eastern European assistance. But Khrushchev also
accepted a more equal relationship between the two countries: Soviet
privileges in Chinese border areas would be abolished, and "joint
companies," set up at Stalin's insistence, would be transferred to
Chinese ownership. He even promised to share Soviet nuclear technology
with the Chinese.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-238}Khrushchev also agreed to send more Soviet
advisers to China. Throughout the 1950s these advisers played a key role
all over the Chinese central administration, regional and provincial
governments, and major industrial enterprises. For young Soviet experts
it became popular to go to China. They had good conditions there. But
they also filled a real need on the Chinese side to replace the losses
from war or exile. Soviet experts advised on every aspect of life in new
China---from working with youth and women, national minorities, or law
and imprisonment, to education, technology, and military training.
Overall the cooperation worked out well. The Chinese looked at the
Soviets as models for what they wanted to become: educated, dedicated,
and efficient. Of course there were cultural clashes, and sometimes the
Chinese resented what they saw as Soviet attempts at lording it over
them. But on the whole the Sino-Soviet alliance was a formidable Cold
War challenge to the predominance of the
West.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en205en">^2^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en205}</p>
<p>One key influence that the Soviets had was in military affairs. More
than ten thousand officers in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) were
trained in the Soviet Union, and countless more were trained by Red Army
instructors in China. The result was a modern Chinese army that looked
increasingly like the Red Army, that served the same purposes
internally, and fought wars more or less in the same way. This new PLA
served three major purposes. First, it was intended to be an effective
fighting force, trained in the latest Soviet military doctrines and
equipped with the best weapons the Soviets and eastern Europeans were
willing to offer. Second, it was to be a laboratory for educating young
Chinese men to serve in a new world of socialism. And third, the army
was intended to help build China's civilian development projects, just
like the Red Army had in the Soviet Union in the past.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-239}Educational reform was another main Soviet
influence. The Chinese wanted to emulate education as it had developed
in the Soviet Union, with an emphasis on science and technology, but
also with broad grassroots programs for literacy, numeracy, and
politics. A main point was to get education to fit in with the Five Year
Plan. The government set the aims of how many engineers, chemists, and
other specialized groups were needed every year. The candidates for
entry were selected according to political, class, and achievement
criteria; they had to be both bright and Red. The Education Ministry
underlined the need to be able to predict the numbers of people who
would be available to send to work in plants and mines every year---just
as in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, students were often given a
specific future work assignment as early as their second year in college
(even though the authorities rarely found it necessary to inform the
students themselves of what lay in store).</p>
<p>The Soviets were aware of the problems the CCP had with governing the
cities. They contributed their advice on urban planning. The socialist
city had to be modern, planned, productive, and secure for the Communist
elite. Broad avenues and big urban squares facilitated the mobility of
workers from home to the factory and back, but they also could come in
handy in case the PLA needed to enter a city center to crush a
counterrevolutionary rebellion. For Beijing---the new national capital
and therefore the showcase for Communist planning---the 1935 General
Plan for the Reconstruction of Moscow served as a concrete model. On one
occasion, somewhat to the horror of Soviet advisers, the Chinese
planners simply superimposed a transparency of the Moscow plan on a map
of old Beijing. The Ming Dynasty city had to give way to socialist high
modernism. The center itself would be rebuilt, with the massively
enlarged central plaza at its heart (now known as Tian'anmen Square). A
new avenue for military parades---called, with some irony, the Avenue of
Eternal Peace---would bisect the old city. In Beijing as a whole, one
million old houses should be destroyed each year, and two million new
ones built. The city should aim for the same population density as
Moscow, with the majority of its inhabitants being industrial workers (a
group that had been only 4 percent of the workforce in 1949).</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-240}Not only the national center, but also the
peripheries would be reconstructed according to Soviet advice. Policy
toward minorities or "nationalities" was an area of particular
importance to the Chinese Communists. They wanted them counted,
categorized, and, first and foremost, controlled. An issue of particular
concern was that more than half of these groups lived in more than one
country. The potential for subversion of Chinese interests seemed
legion, especially since the CCP's relationship with Tibetans, Mongols,
Uighurs, Kazakhs, and others had not always been easy in the past. They
wanted to use the experience of the Soviets in handling minority issues
to their own advantage. The issue had to be dealt with carefully,
though, by both sides, since some of these minorities lived in the
borderlands between China and the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p>The CCP's insistence on "recataloging" its inventory of ethnic groups,
combined with the unprecedented period of regional and local autonomy
created by the wars of the early twentieth century, made for unexpected
results in the 1950s. In the great counting of peoples, local agency
sometimes combined with the intricacies of Marxist-Leninist theory to
give new opportunities to marginal groups. The breakdown into fifty-six
nationalities in China was haphazard and often a product of decisions
made across a table in Beijing. But it still meant that some groups who
had never had their own institutions suddenly found themselves to be one
of China's peoples, with representation all the way up to the National
People's Congress (China's parliament). Though Communist political
repression could hit anyone within China's borders, recognition as a
separate nationality gave some degree of protection from the most
vicious aspects of PRC political campaigns, at least until the Cultural
Revolution began in 1966.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-241}In spite of having come to power at the
head of a peasant army, the CCP took its time in dealing with rural
issues. It waited six years, for instance, before taking the leap into
the full collectivization of agriculture. There were several reasons for
this measured approach. Soviet advice had been to go slow, and not
repeat some of the errors of collectivization in USSR and in eastern
Europe. Many Chinese peasant leaders were skeptics. They knew full well
how peasants had joined the revolution in order to get their own land.
Taking it away from them could be politically dangerous. But Mao's
impatience, supported by younger CCP members who regarded
collectivization as de rigueur for a Communist state, in the end won the
day. By 1956 most land in the central areas was collectivized, growing
to almost 90 percent of all Chinese agricultural produce. By all
indications collectivization in China had been a major success both
politically and economically.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong pondered the apparent successes of collectivization, and then
drew the wrong lessons from them. He started to believe that the CCP had
been too hesitant in carrying out major economic reforms tout court.
Maybe, the Chairman thought, China was holding back too much, paying too
much heed to the advice of planners and Soviet-trained economists.
Perhaps he needed to be bolder, to move more quickly, as the CCP and its
army had done in
war?<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en206en">^3^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en206} For now he
held his tongue, at least in public. But after Khrushchev's speech at
the Soviet Twentieth Congress in 1956, which criticized the dogmatism of
the Soviet past and stressed that all Communist countries had to find
their own way to socialism, the Chairman became more and more outspoken
in stressing China's unique position and its need to speed up its social
and economic transformation.</p>
<p>What jolted Mao into action were the crises in Poland and Hungary in the
autumn of 1956. He and many of his advisers thought that the reason
workers in eastern Europe had rebelled was that the Communist parties
there had not paid attention to local conditions. They had also been too
slow and reluctant in offering the forms of advanced socialism that
would have won the workers' support. The answer to Hungary was, in other
words, not less socialism, but more socialism, especially since the CCP
leadership feared that China itself could be vulnerable to the kinds of
unrest that had happened in eastern Europe. Workers, especially, were
not happy with their lot in China, and reports of strikes came in daily
in the aftermath of the Hungarian revolution. Among such demonstrations,
the party center noted, "some were led by party members and youth league
members; chairmen of... unions participated in some; some were...
stirred up by anti-revolutionaries. In many cases, the masses' blood was
up, with even some administrative leaders yelling '[we] have to fight
till the end.'"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en207en">^4^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en207}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-242}Mao's response was first to open up for
criticism of party practices, to "let hundred flowers bloom," as he put
it. For a few heady weeks in the spring of 1957, Chinese in all walks of
life were allowed---and in some cases encouraged---to give voice to
their own opinions. Then, fearful of the barrage of criticism that hit
them, the party leaders backtracked and launched an "anti-Rightist"
campaign to punish those who had dared to come forward. The "hundred
flowers" criticisms had been of three major kinds. Some felt that the
party was too bureaucratic and dogmatic. Others attacked the lack of
basic political freedoms in China. And the third group claimed that the
party was not nationalist enough; the CCP, they said, put Soviet
interests over those of China. With the venturesome critics now on their
way to labor camps or worse, Chairman Mao began preparing a push for
advanced socialism, which he hoped would let the Communists regain the
popular enthusiasm of the wartime era.</p>
<p>The Great Leap Forward, as he called it, was to become the most lethal
Communist campaign of all time, though it started as shock therapy to
increase industrial production. Mao's concern was that China was not
catching up with advanced countries fast enough. The steady progress of
the first Five Year Plan was good, but it was not sufficient, Mao
thought. China could do better if it relied on its own strength and
initiative. Other Communist leaders, who ought to have known
better---such as President Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the head
of the party apparatus, Deng Xiaoping---got caught up in increasingly
harebrained development plans that would, the Chairman promised,
catapult China into Communism.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-243}The Great Leap was based on Mao's
preoccupation with the power of the human will. Never properly
materialist in a Marxist sense, Mao always believed that all progress
depended on the willingness and ability of people to carry out socialist
transformation. If such plans were not successful enough, it was because
the full human potential had not yet been mobilized. China could combine
a rapid development in agriculture with massively increased industrial
output through the use of manpower, Mao decreed. It should "be possible
for China to catch up with advanced capitalist countries in industrial
and agricultural production in a period shorter than what had previously
been predicted," he explained in the spring of 1958. "China could catch
up with Britain in ten years, and with the United States in another ten
years."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en208en">^5^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en208}</p>
<p>The core units of the Great Leap were the People's Communes, set up all
over China in the summer of 1958. The planning methods of previous years
were thrown overboard, and the new Communes were given entirely
unrealistic production targets. The country's steel production was set
to double in a year, and rural Communes had to contribute to the steel
targets. Sometimes, out of desperation, they did so simply by melting
down their agricultural tools. Millions of peasants were taken away from
their fields during the time of sowing and reaping to work on poorly
planned building or irrigation projects. Inspired by the Soviet virgin
lands campaign, the CCP sometimes forced peasants to leave their own
fields and move to new areas where they had no means of survival. Inside
the Communes discipline and collectivism were taken to the extreme.
Children were housed in separate dormitories so their parents could
dedicate themselves entirely to production.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1958 many people went hungry as they slaved away at
Mao's new schemes. In the spring of 1959 they started dying of
starvation. By the time the nightmare eased, in 1961, at least forty
million had died, most of them from a combination of overwork and lack
of food. Eyewitnesses described it all. In Xinyang, a formerly rich city
in Henan Province, frozen corpses lay in the roads and in the fields.
Some of them were mutilated. Surviving locals blamed wild dogs. But the
dogs and all other animals had already been eaten. Instead, humans had
turned to eating the flesh of their own kind to
survive.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en209en">^6^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en209}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-244}Mao refused to back down. When honest
party members reported on the disaster, he had them purged. One was the
Korean War hero and marshal Peng Dehuai, who spoke up in the summer of
1959. The Soviet advisers, some of whom had at first believed that the
Chinese might succeed in their Great Leap, very soon quietly started to
warn about the consequences. Mao brushed them off. "The Soviet Union has
been building socialism for 41 years, and it couldn't make a transition
to socialism in 12 years. They are now behind us and already in panic,"
the Chairman
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en210en">^7^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en210} At the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Twenty-first Congress in 1959
Khrushchev warned, "Society cannot jump from capitalism to Communism
without experiencing socialist development.... Egalitarianism does not
mean transition to Communism. Rather it only damages the reputation of
Communism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en211en">^8^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en211}</p>
<p>As Mao's China moved to the Left in search of rapid development and
political rectitude, foreign policy issues also started damaging the
Sino-Soviet relationship. During the height of the alliance, the Soviets
and the Chinese had worked closely together in the international arena.
In 1954 they had forced the Vietnamese Communists to accept a settlement
at the Geneva Conference. In 1955, China had been the spokesman for the
Communist camp at the Afro-Asian Bandung Conference. In 1956 they had
not only agreed on the invasion of Hungary but also jointly disciplined
North Korea's Kim Il-sung for his inner-party purges. But Mao's
increasing anti-American rhetoric and his insistence on the
inevitability of war had begun to rile the Soviets. They worried that
China was out of tune with their own charm-offensive vis-à-vis the West.</p>
<p>One key reason for Moscow's worry was the Chinese refusal to further
integrate into the Soviet bloc, militarily and economically. Up to 1958
it was China that had pressed for such integration, with the Soviets
holding back, in part because they feared that China's enormous
population would prove a strain on the Soviet and eastern European
economies. But when the Soviet Ministry of Defense in the summer of 1958
had proposed a few relatively routine steps of military coordination,
such as Soviet-operated early-warning systems and naval communication
transmitters in China, Mao had reacted furiously. "I could not sleep,
nor did I have dinner," he told the surprised Soviet ambassador Pavel
Iudin.</p>

<p>The Soviets were understandably horrified at Mao's rant. Against the
advice of his colleagues, Khrushchev rushed to Beijing to soothe his
irate revolutionary colleague. Mao subjected the Soviet leader to
lectures on the impotence of US imperialism, but was unwilling to enter
into much concrete discussion. Khrushchev returned to Moscow convinced
that he had contained the crisis, only to find that the PRC started to
shell Guomindang-held offshore islands just two weeks after he left
Beijing, deliberately provoking a crisis with the Americans. Even though
Mao had alluded to his desire to "liberate" Taiwan, the Chinese military
action had not been discussed during the visit. The purpose seems to
have been to warn both the Soviets and the Americans that China was
capable of independent action. Khrushchev again stood up for the Chinese
in public, but inwardly he was furious. Mao called an abrupt end to the
confrontation over the islands a couple of months later. He
lackadaisically declared that the PRC in the future would shell
Guomindang-held territory only every second day, so Chiang Kai-shek's
soldiers could venture outside occasionally for some sun and fresh air.
In Moscow, some Soviets started questioning the Chairman's mental
stability.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-246}Other crises followed, even though the
alliance still seemed in workable shape, at least from the outside. In
China, Mao Zedong had to deal with the fallout from the Great Leap and
had less time for foreign affairs. From the summer of 1959 on, however,
it seems as if the Chairman in his own mind began to connect his
domestic troubles with his Soviet problem. Those Chinese who were
challenging his Great Leap policies, he thought, did so because they
were too wedded to the Soviet path of development. If they succeeded in
going back to Soviet ways, they could destroy his revolution. Mao
therefore began sending his closest associates notes that criticized the
Soviets but also took aim at those who doubted the Great Leap. "At the
beginning of the construction of the Soviet Union, the speed of
industrial development was very high. Later,... [it] has decreased.
Soviet planners constantly lowered the speed of development. [This
shows] their right-deviationist
thinking."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en213en">^10^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en213}</p>
<p>If the Soviets were "Right-deviationists," then the alliance was
obviously in some form of trouble. It was one of the most serious
charges one could make against a fellow Marxist. Mao followed up with
further accusations of the same sort. When Khrushchev, after much
preparation, went on the first ever visit of a Soviet leader to the
United States in 1959, Chinese media more or less ignored it, while
stepping up their anti-American propaganda. Worse, Beijing got itself
embroiled in a series of border incidents with India around the same
time, giving much ammunition to anti-Communists both in Asia and in
Washington. Although Delhi was probably about as much to blame for these
clashes as Beijing, Khrushchev was incandescent, both about the timing
and about the target. The Soviets had spent much time and many rubles
buttering up Nehru and the nonaligned Indians. Now Moscow's Chinese
allies seemed intent on throwing it all away.</p>
<p>Very unwisely, Khrushchev again insisted that he himself go to Beijing
and set things right. This October 1959 visit backfired badly. Last time
he had visited, Mao had tried to humiliate Khrushchev. Among other
carefully selected indignities, the Chairman had enticed him into a
swimming pool, well aware that the Soviet leader could not swim. This
time the humiliation was verbal. Meeting with the whole Chinese top
leadership, everyone of them (except Mao himself, of course) took turns
at insulting Khrushchev. Foreign Minister Chen Yi called him a
term-serving opportunist, someone who supported India and therefore also
the bourgeoisie. Khrushchev gave as good as he got. "You should not spit
on me from the height of your Marshal title," he fumed at Chen Yi, one
of the ten marshals of China's civil war. "You do not have enough spit!
We cannot be intimidated! What a pretty situation we have: On one side,
you [still] use the formula [the Communist camp] headed by the
Soviet Union. On the other you do not let me say a
word!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en214en">^11^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en214} The
meetings ended in acrimony.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-247}By late 1959 Mao had concluded that the
Sino-Soviet alliance had to go. He noted to himself that Soviet
"revisionism" could "last for a very long time (over ten years, for
example).... We resisted the fallacies of our friends [the
Soviets]..., [but now] our friends together with the imperialists,
the counter-revolutionaries, and the Tito revisionists organize an
anti-China chorus." But even in isolation, "in eight years China will
have finished the initial constriction of [its] industrial system....
The Chinese flag is bright
red."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en215en">^12^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en215} At
international Communist meetings in the spring of 1960 the Chinese
attacked the Soviets openly. That summer, Khrushchev's patience snapped.
He abruptly withdrew most Soviet advisers from China. Mao complained
publicly, but in private he welcomed his counterpart's rash action. It
would remove Soviet influence in China, and enable him to explain to his
people why Sino-Soviet cooperation---the principle on which his
Communist party had been founded---had broken down.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s it was not easy for the Soviets, the Chinese, or
anyone else to see how completely the Sino-Soviet alliance was coming to
an end. Most people---except Mao himself and some of his younger
followers---expected this to be a temporary quarrel. Both sides were
fundamentally Marxist, and would therefore join together again, it was
thought. Some cooperation continued for a while. The Soviets offered
food assistance when the full extent of the Great Leap disaster was
becoming clear in 1961. Military and intelligence cooperation lasted at
least until 1963. But Khrushchev was sulking and found it hard to reach
out to the Chinese. Mao, on his side, reveled in China's new isolation.
After some hesitation in the wake of the Great Leap, he now declared his
own return to setting the party's ideological agenda and moving it
further to the Left. As so often before, Mao's poetry indicated where he
wanted to go:</p>
<p>::: linegroup
<em>Only heroes can quell tigers and leopards</em></p>
<p><em>And wild bears never daunt the brave.</em></p>
<p><em>Plum blossoms welcome the whirling snow;</em></p>
<p><em>Small wonder flies freeze and
perish.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en216en">^13^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en216}</em>
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-248}Nationalism helped in Mao's plans. His
version was that where all other countries had failed, China would
succeed. This is what most Chinese liked to hear. Even those who had
worked with Mao for almost a generation did not understand that the
break with the Soviets would take China in a disastrous direction. Even
less did they see that it sealed their own fate. The public hero-worship
of the Chairman was intense. Mao was clever enough to push the leaders
whom he suspected of wanting a return to the safety of 1950s-style
economic planning, like Liu Shaoqi or Deng Xiaoping, to the fore in
criticizing the Soviets. By publicly attacking moderation, gradualism,
and traditional Marxist economics, these leaders helped dig their own
graves, in a few cases quite literally, as China descended into another
round of internecine bloodletting in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In the meantime China's foreign policy floundered. Mao spoke about his
country leading the Third World, but the real Third World treated China
with increasing mistrust, not least because of its constant attempts to
teach others how to behave. Beijing's support for minority Communist
parties, often in violent conflict with both the "official"
Soviet-backed Communists and nationalist regimes, did not help either.
Even so, China's Third World strategy initially did pay a few dividends.
The Communist regimes in Vietnam and North Korea, and in Cuba, felt that
China's emphasis on sovereignty and national development suited them
better than the lectures they received from Moscow, and therefore for
some time were closer to Beijing's points of view. The suave premier
Zhou Enlai visited Africa, handing out aid that post-Leap China could
hardly afford, but which Mao insisted had to be given to compete with
the Soviets. But by 1965 almost all of China's Third World links had
soured. Mao's insistence that cooperating with China meant breaking
fully with the Soviets was unacceptable to other leaders. And whoever
did not adopt China's views were immediately characterized by Beijing as
"very arrogant and conceited," as in the case of Algeria's radical
leader Ben Bella in
1965.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en217en">^14^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en217}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-249}But the real disaster for China's Third
World relationships was the 1962 border war with India. This was a
conflict that had been a long time coming. Although China and India had
cooperated for a while after their states were reconstituted in the late
1940s, a decade later they were locked in enmity. The causes were many.
China suspected, with some justification, Nehru's government to be
sympathetic to Tibetan nationalists. India feared that Chinese control
of the Himalayas would put New Delhi at a dangerous strategic
disadvantage. But the most basic problem was that the Chinese Communists
always viewed Nehru's Indian state simply as a colonial construct,
something less than a real country. Nehru, on his side, saw
Chinese-style revolution as a threat not just to his wishes for India's
development, but to the security of all of Asia. "The Indians," Zhou
Enlai had told Khrushchev in 1959, "[have] conducted large-scale
anti-Chinese propaganda for forty
years."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en218en">^15^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en218}</p>
<p>The war broke out when Indian military mountain patrols moved into
disputed areas of the Himalayas in October 1962. Chinese soldiers tried
to force them out, and both sides started shooting. The Indians were on
the offensive first, but the PLA managed to get large reinforcements in,
which pushed the Indian army back. When the fighting ended the Indians
had been thoroughly routed, and the Chinese took control of the disputed
region. The war was a shock to all of Asia, and not least to the members
of the recently formed Non-Aligned Movement, which had India as one of
its principal members. But the main effect was to further isolate China,
who, largely because of its bellicose language, was seen as the
aggressive party.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-250}Increasingly cut off and exposed to one
man's whims, China began its long descent into the Cultural Revolution.
First Mao turned on those who had tried to stabilize the situation after
the Great Leap and who had not understood the need for a full break with
the Soviets. "There was a connection between revisionism at home and
abroad," Mao
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en219en">^16^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en219} In 1962 he
lambasted China's president Liu Shaoqi for having started down the
revisionist road. Wang Jiaxiang, the veteran diplomat who had dared
suggest that China ought not to have too many enemies at the same time,
was called "a deviant
Rightist."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en220en">^17^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en220} But
Mao himself did not know how to reawaken the revolutionary spirit that
he now felt to be absent. In 1963 and 1964 the Chairman bided his time.
He concentrated on strengthening his personal dictatorship, while
reaping the rewards of China's progress in science and technology, most
of which had come about as a result of Soviet aid. A major breakthrough
was China's first nuclear test in 1964. The man who had derided nuclear
weapons as "paper tigers" when China did not itself possess them, now
admitted to his colleagues that he felt much safer when others feared
China more.</p>
<p>In 1965 Mao first turned to settling old scores. A historian and
playwright had written a historical play back in 1959 indicating through
allegory that during the Great Leap righteous officials had been
persecuted while sycophants had been promoted---a pretty accurate
description of reality. Six years later Mao wanted him punished, along
with his boss Peng Zhen, the dour mayor of Beijing. Peng, an old
revolutionary hard-liner, resisted. A furious Mao decided to "rectify"
China's intellectual life and crack down on "deviationists" in the
capital. In November 1965 he left Beijing and began traveling around the
country, never staying long in one place. He was not to return for nine
months. While in Hangzhou, one of his main residences, he lectured
people there: "You should gradually get into contact with reality, live
for a while in the countryside, learn a bit.... There's no need to read
big tomes. It's sufficient to read little books and get a bit of general
knowledge."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en221en">^18^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en221}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-251}With Mao out of Beijing, his underlings
did their best to guess what his plans were. Peng Zhen was dismissed, as
were the heads of the CCP party apparatus and of the PLA's general
staff. Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and a number of younger associates of Mao
got more and more influence over policy-making. Lin Biao, a brilliant
but mentally unstable strategist from the civil war, had been made
defense minister during the Great Leap. In 1966 he was also made Mao's
second in command. Together the new leadership group launched an attack
on the old party institutions: "Those representatives of the bourgeoisie
who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various
spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists.
Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the
dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are
still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons
like Khrushchev for example, who are still nestling beside
us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en222en">^19^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en222}</p>
<p>It sounded similar to Stalin's postwar purges. But Mao wanted to go
further. In July 1966 he was filmed swimming the Yangzi River, probably
to show that at the age of seventy-two he was still fit and healthy.
Then he returned to Beijing. Schools had been suspended so that students
could read the new directives and attack the teachers they suspected of
being counterrevolutionaries. Mao's return was triumphant.</p>
<p>Meeting with the students, Mao instructed them to "bombard the
headquarters" and form Red Guards to defend the revolution. Those
following the capitalist road were planning to take power, he said. But
the most striking instruction from the Chairman was about where these
enemies were to be found. They were inside the party, Mao claimed. By
the autumn of 1966 senior party leaders, pinpointed by Mao, were
attacked in their homes by Red Guard youth. President Liu Shaoqi was
dragged through the streets and publicly humiliated. Deng Xiaoping was
luckier. He was kept in solitary confinement, and then sent to the south
to work as a manual laborer in a tractor factory. Through all of this,
the police and the army stood aside, and chaos reigned on the streets.</p>
<p>President Liu Shaoqi's wife, Wang Guangmei, was kidnapped by Red Guards
at the height of the chaos and tortured. "We want you to put on the
dress that you wore in Indonesia," they shouted at her.</p>
<p>::: blockquote

:::</p>
<p>Mao's plan for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as he called
his new purge, was to deepen the processes of change through removing
the old party leadership and appealing directly to the country's youth
to make revolution. He wanted to fundamentally remake China and remake
the Chinese. His ideal was a new type of man and woman, free from
family, religion, and old culture. Only such a person, Mao claimed,
would be strong enough to complete the transformation of China. He raged
against the party he had led for thirty years. It had held him and the
country back. Now time was running out. Mao felt a need to complete the
work he had begun as a young man.</p>
<p>The Cultural Revolution looked different seen from the top and the
bottom of Chinese society. Seen from above it was a purge like those in
eastern Europe or the Soviet Union. Leaders were removed from power,
ritually humiliated, and killed or sent away. But seen from below it
became a carnival of released tension, in which personal grudges and
aspirations could be played out after decades of intense change. Some
rebelled against authority and authoritarianism, mostly oblivious to the
fact that they did so through supporting Mao's rule, the most absolute
authority of all. Others could simply show and act upon their dislike
for their neighbors, fellow students, or workmates. Factions and
factionalism abounded. In Wuhan, in the summer of 1967, for instance,
two Red Guard groups fought each other for power, first with slogans,
then with fists and knives, and finally with machine guns and 122 mm
howitzers looted from army barracks and depots.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-253}One of Mao's intentions in the Cultural
Revolution was to set the young against the old. In a country where
tradition venerated the elderly, their hold on society needed to be
broken for Mao's vision of "new China" to be complete. Red Guards,
sometimes as young as twelve or thirteen, were encouraged to report on
their parents or grandparents. At times older members of the family were
captured as a result of such denunciation, beaten, or sent away to labor
camps. One family in Beijing, who I know, saw both the father and the
grandfather taken by Red Guards after they had been reported on by the
youngest son. The boy, fourteen at the time, participated in their
public humiliation and torture. The grandfather died as a result. The
pattern was repeated a million times over across China. Though most of
those who were "struggled against" survived, normal family life
understandably did not.</p>
<p>Minorities were among the worst hit groups in the Cultural Revolution.
In Chinese-ruled Inner Mongolia, at least twenty thousand people were
killed as Chinese Red Guards hunted members of the "Inner Mongolian
People's Party." This phantom party, which probably never existed at
all, was claimed to be a counterrevolutionary, separatist organization,
specializing in assassinating Red Guard leaders. In Tibet, Communist
atrocities went even further. Monks were beaten or killed. Age-old
artwork was thrown on the fire. Red Guards, flown in by helicopter,
dynamited or fired missiles against temples and monasteries. Parts of
the country were in a state of civil war for years, as Tibetan groups
counterattacked. In Guangxi, in the south, Zhuang people (and some
Chinese, too) ate their enemies, deemed counterrevolutionaries, in
staged cannibalistic
events.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en224en">^21^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en224}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-254}As can be imagined, China's descent into
chaos during the cultural revolution also led to chaos in foreign
policy. Mao believed that diplomats and foreign affairs experts were
among the worst sinners in betraying his revolution. All ambassadors
were recalled to Beijing for political reeducation, and most of them
never returned to their stations. Instead the Foreign Ministry was taken
over by younger diplomats and other employees, including a former
janitor who had set up a Red Guard unit, who spent their time conducting
political study sessions and engaging in "struggle" against senior
leaders. China's foreign minister, Chen Yi, was denounced in front of
large crowds. The British embassy in Beijing was attacked and set on
fire, while the Soviet and eastern European embassies were besieged by
thousands of Red Guards, who shouted antirevisionist slogans through
loudspeakers night and day. Even China's closest allies, North Vietnam
and North Korea, had had enough of the chaos. They summarily arrested
Chinese advisers who organized pro--Cultural Revolution marches in their
countries and shipped them back to China. After one especially egregious
incident in Pyongyang, in which Chinese students had criticized Kim
Il-sung for not studying Mao's works well enough, the North Koreans
exploded. "Our people are indignant at the arrogant behavior of the
Chinese. The Chinese... are behaving like hysterical people... they are
not able to avoid responsibility for the criminal actions damaging the
interests of the
DPRK."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en225en">^22^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en225}</p>
<p>As political relations between China and the Soviet Union deteriorated,
tension at their long border increased. Already in 1962 there had been
clashes between border guards as Chinese Kazakhs attempted to flee
across to Soviet Kazakhstan to avoid the effects of the Great Leap
Forward. Two years later, Mao laid into the Soviets over the border
issue. "More than one hundred years ago," he told visiting Japanese
Communists, "[the Russians] occupied the entire area east of Lake
Baikal, including Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and the Kamchatka Peninsula.
That account is difficult to square. We have yet to settle that
account."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en226en">^23^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en226} Mao
used the conflict with the Soviets to ratchet up support for his
domestic positions, even though he did not foresee war with the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-255}When the Cultural Revolution started,
Chinese Red Guards began setting up loudspeakers in the border zones,
where they berated the Soviets for following their "revisionist"
leaders. But in 1969 these tensions suddenly took a turn for the worse.
After Chinese and Soviet soldiers had clashed repeatedly over an island
in the middle of the Ussuri River, which both sides claimed, the Chinese
ambushed a Soviet border patrol and killed around sixty troops on 2
March. On Moscow's orders, the Red Army counterattacked two weeks later,
but were unable to dislodge the Chinese from the still-frozen river
region. Large-scale artillery shelling from both sides ensued. In
Moscow, there was a real fear of war. Some Soviet military experts
recommended taking out the Chinese nuclear installations as a
precaution, but the Politburo held back. The Soviet premier tried to
call the Chinese leaders, but the young Chinese operator refused to
connect him with either Zhou or Mao. The operators were told to shout
antirevisionist slogans down the line whenever the Soviets tried to
call.</p>
<p>But Mao's bluster concealed a fear much worse than the one felt in
Moscow. The Chinese leader ordered his side to hold fire. But he also
worried that the Soviets would launch a full-scale nuclear attack on
China. It was one thing to provoke the Red Army at the border in order
to show at home how the Cultural Revolution had made the country more
powerful. It was something very different to risk the survival of China.
As the Soviets sent reinforcements to the border and warned that Moscow
would retaliate against further provocations, including with the use of
nuclear weapons, a full-scale war scare broke out in Beijing in the fall
of 1969. Even though Zhou Enlai and the Soviet premier held talks to
moderate the tension, in early October Mao ordered all party,
government, and military leaders to leave Beijing. All over China,
Communist cadres left the cities to go to the countryside and prepare
for war. Lin Biao, in an even more disordered mood than usual, suddenly
ordered China's military to move to the highest alert. The crisis
passed. But it did remind Mao, forcefully, of how unprepared China was
for a real war and how erratic his new leadership group was.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-256}The Chairman had already begun reining in
some of the worst Cultural Revolution extremists. The army was sent in
to restore order in the cities and on university campuses, and some of
the most vocal Red Guards were sent to prison camps or to do manual
labor, following the many they themselves had mistreated over the
previous three years. The Soviet war scare pushed Mao further in the
direction of reducing tension in China. But the Chairman was also
fearful of any policy that would "reverse the verdict," as he himself
put it, on the Great Leap and the Cultural Revolution. Both were still
good, Mao insisted. He came to depend on advisers who were a mix of
Cultural Revolution leaders, such as his own wife, Jiang Qing, or the
Shanghai Leftists Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, as well as more
traditional CCP figures who paid lip-service to Mao through the
disasters of the 1960s, such as the premier, Zhou Enlai. The leaders who
had been purged were ordered to stay out of view, while
Mao---bizarrely---sometimes would call on them privately for advice in
their provincial hideaways.</p>
<p>With China poor and isolated, and with the Cold War having caught up
with Mao through the Soviet war scare, the Chinese leader temporarily
reduced his revolutionary zeal and agreed that more emphasis had to be
put on production and overall economic development. In the early 1970s,
as the international climate changed considerably, Chinese managers and
officials tried to put things back together again after Mao's campaigns.
But the country still drifted from crisis to crisis. The worst was in
September 1971, when Vice-Chairman and Defense Minister Lin Biao, Mao's
chosen successor, panicked and attempted to flee to the Soviet Union.
Convinced that Mao was out to get him, the increasingly deluded "closest
comrade-in-arms" of the Chairman boarded a military plane with his wife
and son, ordering it to fly toward the border. When asked by Premier
Zhou whether the plane should be shot down, Mao shrugged: "Rain has to
fall, girls have to marry, these things are immutable; let them
go."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en227en">^24^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en227} Lin's plane
crashed in Outer Mongolia, killing all onboard.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-257}Lin's betrayal buried any hopes in the
population at large that the Cultural Revolution could be turned to any
positive effect. What followed was profound cynicism, especially among
younger people. Through their whole lives they had joined in Mao's
campaigns, one more intense and life-changing than the other. They had
learned to revere the Chairman as a god. Their role was to help him
create a new and better China. Now all seemed in ruins. Even though few
were prepared to rebel, people certainly reverted to old standards where
they could. Corruption and nepotism increased considerably. Although
orders to intensify the revolution kept coming from Beijing, not many
were eager to listen anymore. Mao's vision of a Herculean new Chinese
man had turned out to be a monster.</p>
<p><strong>T[HE]{.small-caps} C[OMMUNIST REVOLUTION]{.small-caps}</strong> and the Cold
War had transformed China, though not always in the directions its
leaders or its people had expected. The most important change was the
death of "old China," a patriarchal community of farmers, merchants, and
officials that had been in decline since the nineteenth century and was
finally killed off by the Communists. Instead had come a hybrid society,
with some Chinese and some foreign elements. Marxism, the rulers'
political theory, was of course a foreign import, as was the Communist
Party. New thinking about family, education, technology, and science
came from abroad. What was most distinctly Chinese about the Chinese
revolution was its preoccupation with human transformation, willpower,
and the need to find "correct" ideas and solutions to society's ills. In
ways that were increasingly visible to many Chinese in the 1970s, it was
Mao's preoccupation with ethos over practical gain that had led the
revolution astray. China's lack of resistance to other forms of foreign
influence toward the end of the Cold War was directly linked to this
self-inflicted wound.</p>
<p>Seen from above, Mao's campaigns had all the hallmarks of Stalinist
purges, similar to what had gone on in the Soviet Union and eastern
Europe. Leaders of the Communist party were singled out for criticism,
publicly humiliated, and executed or exiled through some quasi-legal
process. The charges were entirely trumped up and the procedures were
aimed at centralizing power. The president of the country, Liu
Shaoqi---as loyal a party member as could ever be imagined---was beaten
and tortured in public before being sent to Kaifeng during the 1969 war
scare. There he died from mistreatment. Mao wanted to be fully in
command on his own.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-258}But there was also another side to the
Cultural Revolution. As chaos increased on the streets, the authorities
started losing control. Mao was of course in favor of Red Guards
attacking those he wanted to purge. But by 1966 millions of young people
had started traveling the country in the revolutionary cause. Although
much of their days were spent chanting moronic slogans or otherwise
inconveniencing the peasants, their travels did allow them get a sense
of the state of the country. For most, and especially for young women,
this was their first time outside of paternal control. Some of them made
use of it to begin thinking for themselves, even about taboo topics that
could not be raised in public, on issues from sex and gender roles to
economics and politics. A part of China's post--Cold War transformation
came out of this Red Guard generation and its experiences.</p>
<p>Outside of China, Mao's Cultural Revolution madness was picked up by
rebellious students and others who believed it could be used to
challenge authority in their countries. China's Stalinist purges are
therefore sometimes, without reason, conflated with 1960s youthful
rebellions elsewhere. One of the more bizarre twists was in western
Europe, where a few intellectuals formed Maoist groups. They believed
one could worship Chairman Mao and be antiauthoritarian at the same
time. In wealthy Norway, for instance, students formed a group that
called itself the Workers' Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist). They
believed that "the Chinese Communist Party and People's China, both
domestically and internationally, are stronger than ever before....
Never has interest in China and friendship with China been so extensive
[in Norway]."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en228en">^25^</a>{#chapter009.xhtml#en228}
But even if some intellectuals celebrated China's tragedy, most
Europeans could not have cared less. No Maoist party ever got more than
1 percent of the popular vote in elections.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter009.xhtml#page-259}The most important international effect of
China's Maoist era was to kill off forever the idea that Communism was
monolithic. This had of course already become clear to most when Stalin
threw the Yugoslavs out of the eastern bloc in 1948. But China was,
quite literally, on a different scale. The enmity between the Chinese
Communists and the Soviets had the potential to transform international
politics and break Cold War dualism. This could not happen as long as
China seemed mainly preoccupied with tearing itself apart in a Cultural
Revolution. But as soon as the country started to emerge from that
morass, the potential for new global constellations also began to become
visible.

<p>The Cold War was born as an ideological contest in Europe and the
European offshoots, Russia and the United States. In the second half of
the twentieth century that contest came to interact with the processes
surrounding the collapse of the European overseas empires. Europe had
been predominant in international affairs for at least two centuries.
But as the post--World War II re-creation of Asia had shown, this
position of primacy could no longer be taken for granted. And in the
1950s and '60s decolonization sped up, so that by 1970 the number of
independent states had increased almost four times since 1945. They all
wanted to have their say in how the world was run. And they were not
willing to conform to the bipolar Cold War system without a struggle for
their own interests.</p>
<p>Out of this encounter between Cold War and decolonization came the Third
World movement. It was so named by its protagonists in homage to the
Third Estate, the rebellious underdog majority of the French Revolution
of 1789. But its aims were very contemporary. Leaders of newly
independent states, such as Indonesia's Sukarno or India's Nehru,
believed that the time had come for their countries to take center stage
in international affairs. Europeans, a small minority in the world, had
dominated for far too long, and had not done a good job of it. Not only
had they produced colonialism and two world wars, but within colonialism
they had created a political and economic system that only served the
interests of Europeans. The talents, opinions, cultures, and religions
of the vast majority of the world's people had been neglected. Now the
time had come for the disenfranchised to take responsibility not just
for their own liberated countries, but for the world as a whole.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-262}To Third World leaders the Cold War was an
outgrowth of the colonial system. It was an attempt by Europeans to
regulate and dominate the affairs of others, to tell them how to behave
and what to do. Even though many in the newly independent states
distrusted capitalism because it was the system their colonial masters
had tried to impose on them, in most cases they were not ready to
embrace Soviet-style Communism as an alternative. It seemed far too
regimented, too absolutist, or simply too European for postcolonial
states. Even when attempting to learn from the Soviet experience, as
many did, for instance in India or Indonesia, the Third World agenda
implied independence from the power blocs. As developed at the 1955
Afro-Asian Bandung Conference, this agenda stressed full economic and
political sovereignty, solidarity among former colonial countries and
liberation movements, and peaceful resolution of conflict, followed by
nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>For the Superpowers this was a perturbing spectacle. The United States
increasingly put its own national experience at the core of its
perception of global development. As the Cold War hardened, countries
that did not conform to US visions of liberty and economic growth were
believed to be sliding toward a Soviet orientation. The Soviet Union, on
its side, believed that any "third" position was simply a stage on the
way to socialism and eventually the Soviet form of Communism. No wonder
non-Europeans saw significant similarities between the two Superpowers,
in spite of their ideological rivalry. Indeed, leaders such as Ahmed Ben
Bella in Algeria or Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana compared the demands the
Superpowers made on them to colonialism in its latter phase. The
Americans and the Soviets wanted political and diplomatic control, but
also sought development within the framework that the Superpowers could
offer. They were thieves on the same market, even though the US bid for
control was much more powerful, and therefore more pervasive, than
anything the Soviets could muster.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-263}<strong>T[HERE WERE TWO]{.small-caps}</strong> main
reasons why decolonization happened on such a wide scale in the 1950s
and '60s. The first was the social and economic exhaustion of the
colonizing powers. In 1910 a European man, especially if he was French
or British, could still safely assume that he was on top of the global
pile. He may have been poor in his own country, or felt threatened by
suffragettes or revolutionaries. But it was his country that had set the
global agendas for as long as he could remember. The world economic
system was created to make him produce and consume. His culture and his
religion were assumed to be the envy of the world. And others, who were
not Christian Europeans, who did not possess the Europeans' science or
technology, or military skills, or well-honed and ruthless
administrations, were seen as distinctly inferior.</p>
<p>Compare this with a generation later, in 1945. The European countries
were exhausted by warfare and their inhabitants had themselves begun to
doubt their centrality in the world. With what right did they rule
others, when they could not avoid repeatedly tearing their own continent
to pieces? Principles of racial superiority---at least those openly
stated---now had a bad name. Hitler had seen to that. And was not the
primary duty of a young Englishman or Frenchman to his own battered
country, rather than to faraway places? Resources were scarce, and
almost all Europeans wanted them spent at home.</p>
<p>The second reason for decolonization was the rebellion against foreign
rule in the colonies. Although it is unlikely that any anticolonial
movement would have been able to throw the Europeans out by force alone,
these movements increased the cost of colonialism and made the
enterprise less popular at home. Organizations such as the Indian
National Congress or the South African National Congress aimed for
national independence and a basic restructuring of the economy to serve
the native inhabitants of their countries. They wanted their peoples to
be recognized as a new driving force in world history, not as
second-class citizens in their own countries.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-264}The disasters of the two world wars and
the global depression focused these movements politically and magnified
their support. Until the 1920s almost all of them were minority
phenomena, with leaders who had a hard time convincing their countrymen
to take the risk of challenging colonial rule. But thereafter they
increased in size and significance, not least because the colonial
powers tried to stamp them out by force. India's Jawaharlal Nehru had
been imprisoned by the British, as had Gandhi, his political mentor.
Sukarno, Ho Chi Minh, and Ben Bella all spent time in prison and exile.
They became heroes to their peoples, and their anticolonial rhetoric
began to be picked up by many young men and women, often from prominent
families, often trained at the best European or American colleges.</p>
<p>These processes of retrenchment and resistance had been underway since
the start of the century, although they came to the fore after 1945. The
Cold War influenced both, though it did not determine them. The global
economic restructuring, which gradually privileged the United States,
was an important factor in the collapse of formal empires. So was the
Soviet support for liberation movements and the radicalization of some
of them due to the Soviet example. But most important was the Cold War
at home in Europe, the need for Britain and France to strengthen their
own defense, to align with the United States, and the fear, especially
in France, that long-term disorder in the colonies would contribute to
radicalization at home. By the early 1960s, when the focus for the Cold
War was shifting to the Third World, the conflict had already for a long
time played itself out both among colonizers and colonized.</p>
<p>The history of how the Cold War influenced decolonization in economic
terms is strange and somewhat incongruous. British and French high
imperialist ideology of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
had been built on the prospect of improvement for all inhabitants of
their empires, and implied a move away from the naked exploitation of
earlier years. But wars and depression had made the metropoles more
dependent on their colonies in economic terms, not less. They therefore
attempted to reconstitute some of the mechanisms that would favor the
Europeans, but found it difficult to do. Imperial preference systems
counted not only as key examples of what the Americans thought was wrong
with colonialism---restrictions against free trade and US access to
foreign markets---but they also alienated indigenous elites who had
taken the imperial reformers at their word. But on the whole these
measures did not correspond to changing global realities. The United
States and other countries, rather than Britain and France, were
gradually becoming more important for economic development in the
colonies. Meanwhile, economic cooperation and trade in western Europe
was becoming more important for the British and French. It was a
discordance that could not last.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-265}The role of the United States was crucial
in the process of decolonization during the Cold War. Most Americans
believed that colonialism was a bad thing. The country had won its own
independence in a rebellion against Britain. Colonial control meant less
freedom and free trade, both concepts that Americans cherished. But most
white Americans also suspected that nonwhites were not capable of
governing themselves unless assisted by people of European origin. This
fear increased during the first phase of the Cold War. With another
Superpower vying for their attention, Washington was terrified that
postcolonial leaders, easily tempted, would fall into the Soviet bloc.
Anticolonial instincts would therefore have to be tempered by Cold War
concerns in US foreign policy.</p>
<p>US support was the main reason why the European colonial empires did not
all collapse in the 1940s, but went on for another two (or, in the
Portuguese case, three) decades. After 1945, no European country was
financially capable of keeping its colonial possessions given the poor
state of their own economies and their defense needs in Europe. The
chimera of colonialism could only be continued as long as the United
States was willing to underwrite these countries' other expenses at
home. All of the colonial countries were of course aware of this, and
did their best to present their reluctance to decolonize as part of a
common struggle against Communism. US policy-makers, getting used to
working with their western European allies in NATO committees and other
international organizations, far too rarely questioned the motives of
their partners. Washington's own anti-Communist focus mostly overrode
its anticolonialism, except in cases where it was blatantly obvious that
failing to decolonize would stimulate Communist groups, such as in
Indonesia and India. When the British falsely claimed that the Kenyan
nationalist Jomo Kenyatta was controlled by Communists, or when the
French claimed the same for Guinean leader Sékou Touré, the Americans
did not protest, even though their own intelligence agencies told them
that it was untrue.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-266}Both during the Truman and the Eisenhower
Administrations, the Americans were also wary of contributing to the
loss of prestige that letting go of their colonies would lead to for the
European powers. Such a development could threaten stability in Europe
and make the western Europeans less effective in helping to fight
Communism both on their own continent and on a global scale. The fact
that these governments were completely dependent on US loans did not
make things better. It rather made them worse. The British and French
resented the supplication and subservience to the United States that
their economic weakness had led to, and suspected the Americans of
having their own designs on their overseas territories. Impoverished at
home, empire still made them great powers. Britain without empire was
only "a sort of poor man's Sweden," as one British colonial
administrator put
it.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en229en">^1^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en229}</p>
<p>Still, the writing was on the wall for the European empires after 1945.
Even with significant US support, the combination of economic weakness
at home and rising resistance in the colonies determined the outcome.
The governments in Britain and France that completed decolonization were
not of the socialist Left. They were the British Conservatives, led by
Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan, and the French
nationalist Right-wing government of Charles de Gaulle. They regretted
the loss of the colonies but realized they had no choice. As the last
British governor-general of Nigeria, Sir James Robertson, viewed it in
1959: "The trouble is that we have not been allowed enough time; partly
this is because we are not strong enough now as a result of two world
wars to insist on having longer to build up democratic forms of
government, partly because of American opposition to our idea of
colonialism by the gradual training of people in the course of
generations to run their own show: partly because of dangers from our
enemies, the Communists, we have had to move faster than we should have
wished."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en230en">^2^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en230}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-267}On the US side, an increasingly global
military strategy and the need to facilitate access to key resources and
raw materials were big concerns in the decolonization process. US
leaders increasingly saw their country as engaged in a worldwide
campaign against Communism and responsible for building global
capitalist structures that worked well. A US network of military bases
was necessary in this struggle, as was securing the availability of
resources for the economic rebuilding of western Europe and Japan. By
1960, the United States had global access to bases that furthered its
military superiority, and many of these came courtesy of the colonial
powers. In addition to the British and French stations around the world
that the United States could use in case of war, it leased its own bases
in colonial territories from Ascension Island to the Azores and Bermuda.
French-controlled Morocco had a US base. And Diego Garcia, a
British-held island in the Indian Ocean, remained British after
decolonization, mainly so that a massive US military base could be
constructed. The 1,200 people who already lived on Diego Garcia were
evicted.</p>
<p>Throughout the Cold War US leaders were concerned that the Soviets would
be able to control, directly or indirectly, the raw materials on which
America's allies depended for their economic well-being. Such fears were
a main reason why radical Third World nationalism, which included
proposals for economic nationalization, production planning, and export
restrictions, was conflated with Communism or Soviet influence. The Cold
War in resource terms was about absolute control. Anything that assisted
the enemy in getting an influence over vital resources in strategic or
economic terms was a challenge to the United States. This was of course
particularly true for access to metals vital for the military industry.
In the 1940s the most significant of these was uranium, used to produce
nuclear weapons. The United States tried to get exclusive access to
uranium ore from Belgian-ruled Congo and from South Africa, although it
soon became clear that the metal was so scattered in occurrence that
monopolizing access was very hard.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-268}The most important strategic resource
during the Cold War was oil. The first half of the twentieth century had
seen its rise from a minor source of energy to becoming the substance
that made modern states work. Armies depended on it for transport, and
civilian economies depended on it for production. The Soviet Union
became self-sufficient in 1954, so it was not competing with the West
for access to foreign oil for its own sake. But the post-Stalin Moscow
leaders knew how dependent US allies were on oil imports for their
economic development. In western Europe dependence on oil for energy
consumption increased from less than 10 percent in 1945 to over a third
in 1960. In Japan the figures were even more striking: from 6 percent to
40. Eight-five percent of western Europe's imports came from the Middle
East already by 1950. For the United States, which up to 1970 relied
primarily on its own production for domestic use, controlling access to
Middle Eastern oil was therefore still of major strategic importance.</p>
<p>The main oil producers in the Middle East were Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
and the Gulf states. These were all countries in which Britain had been
the predominant foreign power in the first part of the twentieth
century. With British power waning, British-led oil companies were
struggling to hold on to their positions. In Iran, for example,
nationalists were pushing for more of an Iranian stake in the
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), the biggest producer in the country,
which operated the world's largest oil refinery at Abadan. Even though
both profit-sharing arrangements and working conditions for Iranians
were blatantly unfair, AIOC and the British government refused to change
them. The result was the election of a nationalist government in Iran,
led by Mohammed Mossadegh, committed to the nationalization of the oil
industry.</p>
<p>At first, US advice to the British was to compromise. In Saudi Arabia,
where the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO) was the main producer,
the US government had successfully pushed for a 50/50 percent sharing of
profits between the Saudi monarchy and the American owners. But neither
the Iranians nor the British accepted the US proposals. Instead, the
conflict intensified. On 1 May 1951 the Iranian Majlis, the national
assembly, voted to nationalize the oil industry, with compensation for
current owners. The British initiated an embargo on Iranian oil and
appealed to the United States for support. London argued that
nationalization of Iranian oil entailed a strategic danger to the West.
In the wings of Tehran politics, they claimed, waited the powerful
Iranian Communist party, the Tudeh, which would benefit politically from
the nationalization campaign.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-269}The Truman Administration hesitated,
though it was increasingly won over by some of the British arguments.
Even so, Iranian prime minister Mossadegh was no Communist. He had been
a staunch critic of the Soviet occupation of northern Iran, and attacked
the Tudeh on that issue in 1944, saying that "if you claim to be
Socialist, then why are you ready to sacrifice the interest of your own
country for the sake of Soviet
Russia?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en231en">^3^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en231} But
Washington worried about long-term effects and about instability in the
region. As the embargo started having severe economic effects inside
Iran, opposition to Mossadegh grew. His response was to suspend the
Majlis, and to rely increasingly on the Iranian Left, including the
Tudeh, for the support of his policies.</p>
<p>The Eisenhower Administration decided to join with Britain in a covert
operation to remove Mossadegh's government. Using contacts in Iran as
well as paid agents, the CIA organized a stream of misinformation and
staged rallies. In some cases the CIA paid Iranians to pose as Tudeh
members attacking Islamic preachers or the advisers of the monarch, the
Shah. The purpose was both to create unrest on the streets and to unify
the conservative opposition against Mossadegh: the Shah, the Islamic
clergy, and the military. The stage-managed coup, which came in August
1953, almost failed when the young Shah, Reza Pahlavi, lost his nerve
and fled the country. But the military stepped in, arrested Mossadegh,
and crushed the Tudeh party. Pahlavi flew back to Tehran accompanied by
the US director of central intelligence, Allen Dulles. For the next
twenty-six years the Shah ruled Iran as an autocrat, closely allied with
the United States.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-270}In spite of US skepticism about British
motives, the Iran coup had seen the two countries closely aligned. They
had also been working together over the British-declared "emergency" in
Malaya, where British forces from the late 1940s battled and defeated a
Communist-led workers' rebellion. While the United States supported
Britain's warfare in Malaya, Washington stepped up its own campaign
against a Left-wing rebellion in the Philippines. In spite of US
protestations against colonialism, the Philippines had in reality been
held as a colony by the United States since 1898. During the Japanese
occupation, the Philippine Left had carried out the bulk of the
resistance struggle and, when the war was over, campaigned for a fairer
deal for peasants and workers. Granted their independence from the
United States in 1946, Philippine leaders refused the Left's demands.
Later US forces and the Philippine army fought a rebellion by the
People's Liberation Army, the Huks. But by 1954 both the Malayan
National Liberation Army and the Huks had been defeated.</p>
<p>It was Western intervention in the processes of setting up new
independent states that gave rise to the Third World movement.
Anticolonial activists only gradually began using the term, until the
Martinican activist Franz Fanon popularized it in his book <em>The Wretched
of the Earth</em> in 1961. But its contents were visible much before: the
belief that non-Europeans now had the primary responsibility not just
for their own countries, but for the future of the world. The idea that
solidarity among newly decolonized states would create a power bloc out
of the world's majority peoples. And the concept that the Cold War
showed how arrogant, irresponsible, and out-of-touch with global
developments the United States and its European allies were. The Soviet
bloc came in for criticism as well. But it was the Eisenhower
Administration that bore the brunt of Third World ire.</p>
<p>The Afro-Asian conference in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955 became a focus
point for Third World ideas. The Bandung Conference had a long pedigree.
Since the early twentieth century anticolonial activists had been
gathering across borders to create transnational networks of resistance.
By the 1950s a number of key leaders had a transnational background: the
Martinican Fanon fought French colonialism in Algeria, and the
Trinidadian George Padmore played an important role in the creation of
Ghana as an independent country. But at Bandung the new states were in
focus. In his opening speech, Sukarno stressed the responsibilities the
postcolonial states had to work together, defeat colonialism, and
prevent nuclear war. "We are often told 'Colonialism is dead,'" the
Indonesian president told his audience from twenty-nine different
countries and even more nationalist parties and liberation movements.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-271}Let us not be deceived or even soothed by
that. I say to you, colonialism is not yet dead. How can we say it is
dead, so long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are unfree....
Colonialism has also its modern dress, in the form of economic control,
[and] intellectual control.... War would not only mean a threat to our
independence, it may mean the end of civilization and even of human
life. There is a force loose in the world whose potentiality for evil no
man truly knows.... No task is more urgent than that of preserving

and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our

course.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en232en">^4^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en232}
:::</p>
<p>Those who met at Bandung came from very different backgrounds. China was
represented by the smooth premier Zhou Enlai, though others kept the
Chinese at arms' length because of their close alliance with the
Soviets. Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Japan attacked what they saw as
anti-American views at the conference. But the main countries in terms
of the dynamism of their leaders and their role within their regions
were Indonesia, India, and Egypt. Their views had a decisive impact on
the final communiqué, which stressed human rights, sovereignty,
nonintervention, and resistance against Great Power domination. And
their leaders---Sukarno, Nehru, Nasser---hoped that Bandung was just the
first step in setting up cooperation among postcolonial states as an
alternative to the Cold War.</p>
<p>The spirit of Bandung got its first test in the Middle East in the
summer of 1956. At the head of a new radical military government,
Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser was frustrated by fruitless
negotiations with the Americans over loans. He resented that Egypt, long
under British domination, still was forced to accept substantial foreign
influence. Nasser wanted the Suez Canal, bisecting his country, to
revert from British and French to Egyptian control, not least so that
Egypt could benefit more from the substantial income from the canal. The
United States urged negotiations. When London and Paris both declined,
Nasser seized control of the canal zone in a sudden military operation
on 26 July 1956. The Egyptian code word for the immediate start of the
operation, cleverly woven into a lengthy Nasser speech in Alexandria,
was <em>Lesseps</em>---the name of the French engineer who had designed the
canal in the 1860s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-272}In his Suez speech, Nasser summed up the
injustices imperialism had committed not only against Egypt, but against
all Arabs. Arabs had been second-class citizens in their own countries;
they had been divided, or evicted, like the Palestinians. But no longer.
In a speech laden with references to Bandung and anticolonial
solidarity, Nasser declared a new Arab unity, of which Egypt and Syria
would form the initial parts, but which all Arab states could join.
"Since Egypt has declared its free and independent policy, the entire
world has its eyes fixed on Egypt," Nasser said. "Everyone takes account
of Egypt and the Arabs. In the past we were wasting our time in the
offices of [foreign] ambassadors..., but today, after we are united to
form a single national front against imperialism and foreign
intervention, those who disdained us began to fear
us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en233en">^5^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en233}</p>
<p>The British and the French reacted with fury. To British prime minister
Anthony Eden, Nasser was another Hitler, or at least a Mussolini.
Together with the Israelis, London and Paris came up with a harebrained
conspiracy, by which Israel would first invade Egypt. Then the British
and French would intervene, claiming to separate the warring sides.
Finally, as a simple addition, they would retake the Suez Canal. The
Israelis went into action 29 October 1956, just as---in another
theater---the Hungarian crisis reached its peak. French and British
forces invaded Egypt on 5 November. With fighting in the canal zone, the
crisis escalated. President Eisenhower was enraged. He had been kept
completely in the dark about the plans of his allies, and now felt that
he had "just never seen great powers make such a complete mess and botch
of things."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en234en">^6^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en234}
Particularly after the removal of Mossadegh, Washington was eager to
avoid being seen as an opponent of nationalism in the region. This was
especially true for the Arab countries, where the CIA feared that any
display of British and French colonialism would give the local
Communists a leg up against more "healthy" nationalist
forces.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en235en">^7^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en235}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-273}The United States demanded an immediate
cease-fire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. The president let
the British know that if they did not comply, the Americans would refuse
to sell or transport oil to them, much more important now that the Suez
Canal was closed, and cancel further loans to prop up the flagging
British economy. When Eden hesitated, the US Treasury hinted that they
might start selling British pounds, thereby further weakening a currency
already in near free fall. Eden and his French colleague Guy Mollet,
threatened by similar measures, capitulated and withdrew. The Israelis,
chastised by the US president in ways that shocked Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion, followed a few months later. They only complied after
Eisenhower had gone public with his complaint. In a television address
to the American people, the president asked whether "a nation which
attacks and occupies foreign territory in the face of United Nations
disapproval [should] be allowed to impose conditions on its own
withdrawal? If we agree that armed attack can properly achieve the
purposes of the assailant, then I fear we will have turned back the
clock of international
order."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en236en">^8^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en236}</p>
<p>There were many reasons for Eisenhower's fury. His sense of betrayal
after not having been informed by his allies was strong. The United
States, after all, saw itself as the leader of the "free world."
Eisenhower suspected that the invaders had timed their operation to
coincide with the US presidential vote, in which he was seeking
reelection, thereby hoping for a weaker US response. The co-incidence
with the Soviet invasion of Hungary also jarred, since it invited people
across the world to compare the two actions. Eisenhower's assistants
feared that the attack on Egypt would make it easier in the future for
the Soviets to gain a foothold in the Middle East. But the most
important concern was the European powers' willingness to sacrifice
larger Cold War interests to achieve short-term, narrow, national gain.
For Eisenhower this was a deadly sin, since it, in his mind, deflected
from the purpose for which the United States was fighting the Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-274}The outcome of the Suez crisis was also
manifold. It made it abundantly clear, if further confirmation was
needed, that Britain and France could no longer take independent action
in foreign affairs against the will of the United States. For both
countries this was a visible setback for national prestige, even though
the realities of the matter had been clear for more than a decade. But
Suez also showed that public opinion in the postcolonial world counted,
and, as with Hungary, there was a price to pay for displaying naked
power too openly. Speaking to the Indian parliament, Nehru summed it up:
"The use of armed forces by the big countries, while apparently
[achieving] something, it has really showed its inability to deal with
the situation. It is the weakness which has come
out."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en237en">^9^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en237} With
characteristic panache, Nehru told them, "The greatest danger which the
world is suffering from is this Cold War business. It is because the
Cold War creates a bigger mental barrier than the Iron Curtain or brick
wall or any prison. It creates barriers of the mind which refuses to
understand the other person's position, which divides the world into
devils and
angels."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en238en">^10^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en238}</p>
<p>After Suez, decolonization sped up, both because of further British and
French weakness and because it had become increasingly clear that the
future for the two countries lay in Europe and in the transatlantic
alliance, not in Africa or Asia. France had been forced out of Indochina
in 1954 and was fighting a colonial war in Algeria that was going badly
and attracted unwelcome American criticism. Elsewhere the French
withdrew reluctantly. The governments of the Fourth Republic were caught
among competing priorities: Being anti-Communist (while also wanting to
appear radical); resenting US domination (while also fearing US
abandonment); and embracing European integration (while also fearing a
drop in French independent power and prestige). The French governments
wanted US support, and therefore reported on the threat of Communism in
independence movements from Senegal to Madagascar to Tahiti. But they
also feared that the United States was out to replace France in its
former colonies. French intellectuals denounced US imperialism, while
some of them found it hard to abandon France's own colonialism,
which---by strange twists of terminology---was supposed to be more
moral, involved, committed, and "authentic" than any other. France knew
Africa; the Americans did not, was an often underlined perception in
French newspapers. But the subtext---that "knowledge" entitled continued
exploitation---was as little said out loud in Paris as in London.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-275}Some Frenchmen and other Europeans, and a
smaller number of Africans, believed that the colonial empires could
still somehow be transformed from within. They believed in an
integrationist form of a British Commonwealth or <em>Union française</em>,
where democratic values and the culture of the metropolitan state could
be embraced by the former colonials, creating what some Parisian
intellectuals called <em>Eurafrique</em>. Everyone, regardless of race, would
be a citizen with equal rights, the argument went. The closeness of the
colonizers and the colonized was substantially greater than among
different countries in Europe. Why should progressives support European
integration, while encouraging disintegration overseas? Not
understanding that it was much too late for such an argument, the French
Communists, for instance, went through considerable political
contortions on the issue. The French Communist Party (PCF) wanted to see
the "liberation" of the colonies, but not their separation from France.

declared PCF leader Maurice
Thorez.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en239en">^11^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en239}</p>
<p>For the main leaders in the colonized world in the 1950s and '60s, the
issue was not promises of future integration but decolonization and
anticolonial solidarity. The issue of race was essential. Colonialism
was in its essence a racist project, and the lack of US support for full
decolonization reminded many Third World leaders of racial oppression
against African-Americans in the United States. But the European Left
was also to blame. In his 1956 resignation from the PCF, whom he had
been elected to represent in the National Assembly ten years earlier,
the black Martinican writer Aimé Césaire castigated the Eurafrique idea:
"Look at the great breath of unity passing over all the black countries!
Look how, here and there, the torn fabric is being re-stitched!
Experience, harshly acquired experience, has taught us that we have at
our disposal but one weapon, one sole efficient and undamaged weapon:
the weapon of unity, the weapon of the anticolonial rallying of all who
are willing, and the time during which we are dispersed according to the
fissures of the metropolitan parties is also the time of our weakness
and defeat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en240en">^12^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en240}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-276}Nowhere was the weapon of unity more
tested than in the Algerian struggle for liberation. Different from the
British case, where all colonies (except, some people would say,
Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) were far away overseas, Algeria was linked
with France by the Mediterranean. The country had been invaded by the
French in the 1830s, and by the late 1950s had around 1.2 million
European settlers in a total population of eight million. Anticolonial
rebellions had been frequent, and the National Liberation Front (FLN)
began a campaign of armed struggle against the French in 1954. The
French government responded with a massive anti-guerrilla operation,
during which atrocities were committed on both sides. At its peak,
France kept half a million soldiers in Algeria, most of whom could be
paid only because of US support for the government in Paris. Even so,
the operation did not succeed in rooting out the FLN, which by 1957
controlled significant parts of the country.</p>
<p>In May 1958 a military coup by French officers in Algiers threatened to
split not just Algeria, but France as well. The officers, and the
settlers who supported them, insisted that there could be no
negotiations with the FLN. They demanded that General Charles de Gaulle,
unconstitutionally, return as French president. To underline their
military power, the rebels took control of Corsica and threatened to
march on Paris. De Gaulle, who had been out of power since 1946,
returned as the savior of the (French) nation, declaring his
anti-Communism and his commitment to keeping Algeria a part of France.
But even if given near dictatorial powers, he could do little to change
the tide of the Algerian war.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-277}De Gaulle spent four years trying to keep
Algeria French. In the end he failed because the Cold War priorities of
the United States had little time for France's last colonial war. On the
contrary, the Americans found de Gaulle difficult and suspected his war
to be lost already. The FLN conducted very skillful diplomatic
offensives, in which they challenged the anticolonial credentials of the
United States. Why would a nation itself born in a struggle against
empire not condemn the French occupation of Algeria? De Gaulle struck
back at Washington's hesitation, declaring that France would have to
acquire its own nuclear weapons, since the United States and the Soviet
Union were obviously out to divide the world between them, and diminish
France. The Eisenhower Administration did not think de Gaulle could
afford to break with the West, but worried about the impact its alliance
with France had elsewhere. "As long as the Algerian conflict continues,"
a National Security Council study concluded in 1959, "France will be a
liability in U.S. relations with the Afro-Asian bloc, as well as in the
Middle East."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en241en">^13^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en241}</p>
<p>The British Conservative government, which had sworn never to abandon
the British Empire, ended up giving eight countries independence between
1958 and 1962. In most cases the process was peaceful, even though the
new postcolonial governments often found it difficult to sustain their
authority. Ghana had been the first African colony to gain independence,
in 1957. There, the charismatic nationalist leader Kwame Nkrumah became
the first prime minister, though Nkrumah was keen on getting a more
prominent place in the liberation of Africa than just being the head of
one small country. In spite of his declared commitments, de Gaulle
played the same role for the French colonies as the Conservatives had
done on the British side. In French West Africa, Guinea became
independent in 1958 and declined all association with the former
metropole. Fourteen more French territories became independent between
1958 and 1962. In Algeria, de Gaulle also capitulated in the end. Unable
to win the war, and under strong international pressure, Paris agreed to
withdraw its forces and grant independence to its former colony. The FLN
took power in Algiers in the summer of 1962, a radical anticolonialist
government that was intent on symbolizing the power of the Third World.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-278}For the Soviet Union, the view of the
world also started to change in the late 1950s. The Soviet state was
founded on the principle of world revolution and the overthrow of
imperialism and other forms of feudal and capitalist oppression. In the
first decades of Soviet rule, the prospect of "revolution in the east"
had taken on an increasing significance, especially since "revolution in
the west" failed to materialize. The Comintern set up schools and
training institutes in the USSR for Communists from outside of Europe,
and they helped organize parties and Communist groups in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America. The Communist University of the Toilers of the East,
a sort of finishing school for Asian revolutionaries, had been set up in
Moscow in 1921, with branch campuses in Baku, Irkutsk, and Tashkent. It
trained an astonishing array of leaders, including the head of the
Indonesian Communist Party, Tan Malaka; China's Deng Xiaoping; and
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh (who would later serve as a Comintern agent all
over southeast Asia and southern China). During the interwar period,
Soviet universities attracted anti-imperialist students from most Asian
and some African countries, with especially large groups from China,
Vietnam, India, the Middle East, and Turkey. Not all of these were
Communists, but all of them were attracted to the Soviet Union because
of its proclaimed opposition to colonialism and European domination.</p>
<p>Lenin's stated policy of creating "united fronts" with non-Communist
Left-wingers and anti-imperialists, especially in the colonized world,
paid great dividends for Soviet foreign policy and for the
radicalization of the anticolonial movement. Even the turns and twists
of the Comintern in the late 1920s, as Stalin secured his hold on the
Soviet Communist Party, did little lasting damage to the attraction of
working with the Soviets for a common cause. For anticolonialists, the
Soviet Union was both an inspiration as a social and economic model, and
a source of practical support. For many Soviets, especially of the
younger generation, helping the anti-imperialist struggle added luster
to lives that were becoming harder at home. And for the Communist
leadership, supporting anticolonial revolution made strategic sense,
even if it was not led by their ideological brethren. It was a way of
hitting the imperial centers in Europe---London, Paris, Brussels---which
could not be achieved through a weak Communist movement in Europe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-279}The perceived closeness of the Communist
cause and the anti-imperial one was witnessed at a number of conferences
from the 1920s to the 1940s. One starting point was the first
International Congress against Imperialism and Colonialism held in
Brussels in 1927. The conference had been planned by German Comintern
agents, primarily the colorful Willi Münzenberg, a master of setting up
united-front organizations. Münzenberg used the anti-imperialist
campaigns in China, led by the Guomindang, as the summons to the
meeting. The conference had attracted international participants ranging
from anti-imperialist Europeans, such as Albert Einstein and Henri
Barbusse, to Jawaharlal Nehru; Song Qingling, the widow of the first
Chinese president, Sun Yat-sen; and other Asian, African, and Caribbean
activists. A number of US civil rights organizations were represented,
including African-American and Puerto Rican groups. Very soon the
Comintern handlers lost control of the proceedings, which turned into a
denunciation of European control rather than the celebration of the
links between anticolonialism and socialism that they had hoped for. The
Senegalese Communist Lamine Senghor stressed that his primary commitment
was to the replacement of empires by democracies that embraced racial
equality: "Slavery is not abolished. On the contrary it has been
modernized.... We know and ascertain that we are French when they need
us to let us be killed or make us labor. But when it comes to giving us
rights we are no longer Frenchmen but
Negroes."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en242en">^14^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en242}</p>
<p>The difficulties the Soviets had with controlling global
anti-imperialism was also seen in their problems with handling the
multinational empire they had inherited from the tsars. At first, the
Communists encouraged the non-Russians (and especially the
non-Europeans) to take up leading positions in their own areas, which
were made into Soviet republics or autonomous regions. Groups such as
the Tajiks or the Uzbeks, who had been conquered by the Russian empire
in the nineteenth century, were now told that they should aspire to run
their own republics within the Soviet federal state. Even smaller
groups, which had never known any form of independence, such as the
Kalmyks or the Udmurts, also got their own territories. Russian
ethnographers were hard at work identifying nationalities in order to
give them their rights, promote their language, and provide education,
all under the aegis of Communist advisers. A main enemy of the USSR,
Lenin had stated, was Great-Russian chauvinism. He feared that after his
death, "the infinitesimal percentage of Soviet and Sovietized workers
will drown in that tide of chauvinistic Great-Russian riffraff like a
fly in milk."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en243en">^15^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en243}
But in most cases the policy of <em>korenizatsiia</em> (nativization) continued
into the early 1930s, in spite of Stalin's fears of independent
authority in the republics.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-280}But when Stalin in the 1930s turned to
massive terror to uphold his dictatorship, the knell sounded for Asian
national aspirations within the Soviet Union. Those who had argued for
principles of national, religious, or cultural autonomy disappeared into
the labor camps, as did many of their Russian advisers, as well as a
sizeable number of foreign anticolonialists who had taken refuge in the
USSR. Some prominent Soviet Muslim anti-imperialists, such as the
Bashkir leader Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev, were executed in prison. Stalin
wanted a unified Soviet state under his personal leadership, a state
that could eventually challenge for hegemony in Europe. To the Georgian
Communist Stalin, Europe was where the future of the world would be
decided. The colonial world was at best a sideshow, and at worst a
distraction. Inside the Soviet Union the former Russian colonials should
be integrated into the Soviet state. Outside, anticolonialists were
mainly of interest if they could further the security interests of the
USSR. Even the massive postwar turn toward overthrowing European control
in India, Indonesia, and China seemed of less consequence to Stalin.
Although after 1945 he spoke about how anti-imperialism would weaken the
United States and its allies, his gaze was firmly fixed on Europe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-281}Little wonder, then, that Stalin's
successors felt that the <em>vozhd</em> had missed a trick with regard to the
Third World. In what amounted to a direct, though implicit, criticism of
the late dictator, Khrushchev and his colleagues set out to visit
countries in Asia and the Middle East in the first few years after
Stalin's death. Khrushchev himself went to India, Burma, and Afghanistan
in 1955. While visiting newly independent states, Khrushchev's message
was always the same: all those who broke away from colonialism could
count on the support of the Soviet Union. Gone were the days when the
Soviet Union mainly lectured its own truths to new countries. Now the
emphasis was on practical cooperation, which would serve both sides
alike, and which would, eventually, improve the conditions for a
transition to socialism worldwide. "The peoples which achieved national
independence have become a new and powerful force in the struggle for
peace and social progress," Khrushchev told the Higher Party School in
Moscow in January 1961. "The national liberation movement deals more and
more blows against imperialism, helps consolidation of peace,
contributes to speeding mankind's development along the path of social
progress. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are now the most important
centers of revolutionary struggle against
imperialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en244en">^16^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en244}</p>
<p>By 1960 the Soviet Union had expanded its reach into the Third World
considerably. Even countries that opposed Cold War divisions and those
that had pledged allegiance to the Bandung agenda were happy to turn to
the Soviets for practical support. After the Suez crisis, Egypt had
begun a long-term development program supported by the USSR. Indonesia,
Cuba, and several west African states, including Ghana, Guinea, and
Mali, began cooperating closely with the Soviets. In spite of its
worsening relations with China, the USSR seemed to have no trouble
finding friends in the Third World. India was one of the big prizes, and
in spite of its nonaligned policy, Nehru's government had started
drawing on the Soviet experience in building its own form of socialism.
They expected the influence to go in both directions, however. The
Indian ambassador to Moscow, K. P. S. Menon, reported that India's
"friendship with the Soviet Union is paying dividends not only in the
shape of... technical assistance but in a certain softening of the
contours of Communism and the boring of a passage, through which
goodwill---and good sense---can flow between the two
Blocs."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en245en">^17^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en245}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-282}The crisis that would demonstrate both the
reach and the limitations of Soviet power in the Third World happened in
Congo. The poor and exploited Belgian colony got its independence
suddenly in 1960, when there were no roads connecting the different
parts of the vast country and little economic development, except in
European-owned mines. Congo had a total of sixteen university graduates,
no doctors, no high school teachers, no military officers, and no
nationwide political parties. Everything had been run by the Belgians.
When the colonial administrators left, the new leadership, under Prime
Minister Patrice Lumumba, did its best to avoid collapse. Lumumba was a
radical Congolese nationalist, a former postal clerk who had campaigned
for Congo's independence and who headed the only political party with at
least some representation in most of the country's many provinces. The
Belgians detested him, and preferred to work with separatist groups to
keep their mining interests intact. The Americans opposed him, since
they saw the Left-wing Lumumba as a possible conduit between Moscow and
his country's mineral riches. Within weeks of independence, Congo was
fragmenting. Lumumba appealed for, and got, the dispatching of UN
troops, but not their assistance in keeping the country together. In
desperation, he appealed publicly to the Soviets for assistance.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Congo crisis, the Eisenhower Administration
had viewed Lumumba as a threat to US interests in Africa. According to
Secretary of State Dulles, it was "safe to go on the assumption that
Lumumba had been bought by the
Communists."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en246en">^18^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en246} The
United States tried to prevent him from coming to power and, when he was
in power, tried to get him ousted through a military coup. Meanwhile,
Lumumba condemned Western policies: "We know the objects of the West.
Yesterday they divided us on the level of a tribe, clan and village.
Today, with Africa liberating herself, they seek to divide us on the
level of states. They want to create antagonistic blocs, satellites,
and, having begun from that stage of the cold war, deepen the division
in order to perpetuate their
rule."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en247en">^19^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en247} But the
appeal for Soviet support---which started slowly arriving in
Kinshasa---signed Lumumba's death warrant. The CIA planned an
assassination attempt in September 1960, but, before it could be carried
out, the prime minister was overthrown by the military. They handed him
to his secessionist enemies in the province of Katanga, where he was
tortured, and murdered three months later.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-283}For Khrushchev and his advisers the Congo
crisis was an eye-opener. A legitimate African government had appealed
for Soviet support, and in July 1960 Khrushchev had promised to help:
"If the states that are ingeniously carrying out an imperialist
aggression against the Republic of Congo... continue their criminal
actions, then the Soviet Union will not refrain from decisive measures
to stop the aggression. The government of Congo can be sure that the
Soviet government will offer to the Republic of Congo the necessary help
that can be required for the triumph of your just
cause."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en248en">^20^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en248} Six
months later Lumumba was dead, Congo was under the control of a
US-supported military dictatorship, and the only thing the Soviets could
do in response was to fulminate and name a new college for foreign
students in Moscow after the martyred Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba
University. The Soviet Union did not yet have the logistic or military
capacity to project its power to central Africa. It was a lesson those
Central Committee staffers, Red Army officers, and KGB officials who had
been involved would never forget.</p>
<p>For other Third World states, Congo's tragedy was also a sign of their
own weakness. Ghana and Egypt had hoped to help Lumumba stay in power,
but they were too weak and too slow to do so. The only way out, both
Nkrumah and Nasser concluded, was to strengthen the economic development
of their own countries. Other core Third World regimes, such as Ben
Bella's Algeria, thought likewise. Only if national economic development
could be jump-started through state intervention and planning could
their countries grow powerful enough to satisfy the aspirations of their
own peoples while also acting in solidarity with others. The Soviet
economic experience had some of the keys to such growth, but these had
to be invigorated and maximized through the abilities of the new states'
own populations. A common Third World belief was that by removing
colonial controls and creating a state that acted on behalf of the
people, quick economic growth could be achieved. Instead many leaders
found that their countries did not have the expertise needed to advance
fast, especially in building new industries, and that the few resources
they could export were still hostage to conditions set by multinational
companies and international trade regimes. Almost from the beginning,
many countries found that development efforts were hampered by
increasing levels of official corruption. By the mid-1960s many
Africans, especially, found that they were worse off in their daily
lives than they had been under colonial rule. They were beginning to
look for more stability, order, and incremental progress than the
postcolonial regimes were able to offer.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-284}Algeria is a good case in point. The man
who emerged as the key leader of the FLN, Ahmed Ben Bella, had become
radicalized when he served in the French army and later in France as a
political prisoner. When the country finally got its independence, Ben
Bella's government nationalized most industries and aimed for a gradual
nationalization of Algeria's oil industry, the most important economic
activity in the country. Land that had been abandoned by its European
owners, most of whom fled to France after 1962, was given over to
peasants' and laborers' self-managing collectives. Agricultural
production dropped as a result of lack of expertise, equipment, and
investments. The plans to build new industries were mainly unfulfilled,
in part because those who were supposed to build them had enough to do
fending for themselves and their families as prices rose and rapid
urbanization drove rents up. The Algerian growth rate in the Ben Bella
years was not low: a little bit less than 5 percent on average. But this
was mainly due to oil exports. All other industries declined, and the
state spent its oil income inefficiently and erratically. As doubts
spread, Ben Bella himself became increasingly autocratic, given to long
public speeches in which he sought support for the immediate
implementation of policies ranging from the nationalization of
newspapers to the introduction of compulsory membership in the Muslim
boy scouts. The crowds shouted "Long Live Ben Bella," but when the
military deposed him in 1965 most Algerians seem to have drawn a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-285}In spite of its domestic failures,
however, Ben Bella's Algeria became a centerpiece for Third World
revolutionaries from Africa and the Middle East. Two of the main groups
fighting against Portugal, which still held on to its African colonies,
were headquartered there---the Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and
Cape Verde (PAIGC). Nelson Mandela, the leader of the South African
National Congress (ANC), spent time in Algiers, where he received
military training, as did revolutionaries from Congo, Rhodesia, and
Palestine. Malcolm X and other African-American militants visited, and
several of the leaders of the Black Panther movement later took refuge
there. Many of Ben Bella's key advisers were western Europeans or
Yugoslavs (but very few Soviets). Together with the Egyptians, the
Indonesians, and the Indians, Algerian leaders underlined that only
broad international solidarity and cooperation could complete the
decolonization of Africa and break away from the stranglehold of the
Cold War.</p>
<p>In 1961, the year before Algeria gained its independence, an extensive
coalition of states had joined together to form what was to become the
Non-Aligned Movement. All of them felt that the Cold War threatened
their international interests and was in the way of their domestic
development plans. Many of the same countries participated in the
founding congress as had taken part in the Bandung Conference six years
earlier. But nonalignment was not simply a follow-up to Bandung.
Solidarity among peoples, and especially racial solidarity, was
conspicuous by its absence. Instead the conference focused on the part
of the Bandung agenda that underlined sovereign rights of states and the
need for international peace as a precondition for the abolishment of
all forms of colonialism and foreign intervention. With the first
meeting held in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, the new initiative was
intended to be much broader than just the independent countries of Asia
and Africa. The purpose was to challenge the Cold War system through new
forms of international cooperation. China was not invited, but Cuba was
a full member from the beginning, as was Cyprus and even conservative
monarchies such as Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia. Sukarno summed it up in
his address:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter010.xhtml#page-286}Non-alignment is not directed against any
one country, or against any one bloc, or against any particular type of
social system. It is our common conviction that the policy of
non-alignment is the best way for each of us to make a positive
contribution toward the preservation of peace and the relaxation of
international tension. And let us be quite frank: It is no mere accident
that we countries gathered here happen to be the ones who have set
ourselves on the path of non-alignment.... This is the era of emerging
nations and a turbulence of anti-nationalism, the building of nations,
and the breaking of
empires.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en249en">^21^</a>{#chapter010.xhtml#en249}
:::</p>
<p>By the early 1960s decolonization had changed the world beyond what most
people could have imagined in 1945. Not only were there many more
independent countries around, but all of the new countries were led by
non-Europeans. Europe, on the contrary, had lost much of its power, not
least because the postcolonial states demanded their own say in world
affairs. A majority of them disliked the international order that the
Cold War had created. They felt constrained by it and believed it to be
yet another form of European control. But at the same time the Cold War
was inexorably engulfing them through conflicts at home and abroad.
Already by the end of the 1960s rulers in what had constituted the Third
World were searching for stability and new forms of economic growth, be
it through Soviet or American models. Many of these second generation
leaders were military men who preferred orderly change over revolution.
The Third World was a moment; fifteen years after Bandung, more and more
new states found it difficult to manage without strong links to one or
the other Superpower.

<p>The record of General Eisenhower's tenure as a US Cold War president was
decidedly mixed. Backed up by his vast international experience,
Eisenhower had avoided the sense of permanent crisis and frequent
distress of his predecessor. He had extricated the United States from
the Korean War and---equally importantly---avoided getting the country
directly involved in new wars in Asia. But Eisenhower had also overseen
a vast militarization of the Cold War, in which the US arsenal had
expanded from 370 warheads in 1950 to more than 40,000 in 1960. He had
alienated radical nationalists in the Middle East and Latin America
through his covert interventions in Iran and Guatemala. And---mainly for
domestic ideological reasons---he had failed to make use of the
opportunities after Stalin's death for a real relaxation of the conflict
with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Much of Eisenhower's more forward thinking seemed to come as an
afterthought to the general. His attempts at reaching out to Third World
leaders and arranging regular summits with the Soviets came right at the
end of his presidency. Symbolically, his final meeting with Khrushchev
had been cancelled because the USSR had shot down an American spy plane
inside Soviet airspace. Having presided over the greatest buildup of
military capacity in US history, Eisenhower in his farewell address went
on to warn Americans that</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-288}We have been compelled to create a
permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three
and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense

military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American
experience.... We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted
influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial
complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists
and will persist.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en250en">^1^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en250}
:::</p>
<p>The legacy Eisenhower bequeathed to his successor was therefore a
troubled one. The young president-elect, John F. Kennedy, struggled with
contingencies left over from the last administration and those created
by a rapidly changing world even before he took office in January 1961.
He battled to understand, and then deal with, a crisis in Laos, where
insurgents were threatening a US-supported government. He attempted to
reach out to Congress to get its Democratic leaders to support a broader
US involvement abroad, higher defense expenditures, and more aid to
developing countries. And he tried to show a skeptical military and
intelligence service that a young, Democratic, and Catholic president
would not only be fully in charge but also better able to win the Cold
War than his experienced predecessor. It was a frenetic first year in
office, with promise and defeats in roughly equal measure.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy was the first American president born in the twentieth
century. He was also the youngest person ever elected president, a
forty-three-year-old who took over from a man nearly thirty years his
senior. As the first Catholic president, Kennedy's election was a sign
that the US political elite was gradually extending into new demographic
territory. From a wealthy Bostonian family of Irish immigrants, Kennedy
would still get to know the slings and arrows aimed at him for being
nouveau riche in a city where old money was revered. But he made up for
it through a buoyant personality and a combative political demeanor.
JFK---like some American presidents, he was known by his initials---had
been brought up to win, in life as in politics, and he had the
intelligence and charm that often allowed him to do so.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-289}There was enormous enthusiasm across the
country on Kennedy's election, even though it was a hard-fought contest
against Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, and a very narrow
win. Still, Kennedy's youth, his vigor, and his general attractiveness
(not least alongside that of his wife, Jacqueline) enthused people, far
beyond those who had supported him politically. His rhetoric was also
scintillating. JFK spoke about the need for change and about America
triumphant, always a winning combination in US politics (and a far cry
from his predecessor's measured style). In his inaugural, the new
president alerted the Soviets that he was</p>
<p>::: blockquote
unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to
which this nation has always been committed.... In the long history of
the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of
defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from
this responsibility---I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us
would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The
energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will
light our country and all who serve it---and the glow from that fire can
truly light the
world.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en251en">^2^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en251}
:::</p>
<p>As he had done in his campaign, after his election Kennedy spoke about
the possibility of the United States losing out to the Soviets.
Stability was not enough, he claimed, in an indirect attack on his
predecessor. JFK wanted the United States to <em>win</em> the Cold War, though
it was always unclear to him what such a victory would consist of.
During the campaign he had claimed, quite inaccurately, that there was a
"missile gap" that separated increased Soviet capabilities from those of
the United States in terms of nuclear weapons. In fact the situation was
the reverse, and Kennedy probably knew that. But he used the fictitious
"gap" to illustrate his willingness to get one over on the Soviets in a
competition for global power. To JFK, the 1960s was a decade of enormous
danger and enormous opportunity. The world was plastic, and it was up to
the United States to mold it into a new shape.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-290}Over time, Kennedy's belligerent approach
would be tempered by events. In a presidency tragically cut short, the
defining moment was the Cuban missile crisis, when the Soviet Union and
the United States got closer to nuclear war than at any other point
during the Cold War. In the time that was left to him after that crisis
in October 1962, Kennedy was more serious about seeking compromise and
therefore a lasting peace. But he always remained strongly ideological.
More of an intellectual than any other US Cold War president, Kennedy
thrived on discussing ideas and trying to understand change. He believed
in the Wilsonian creed, that it was only by making other countries more
like the United States that his country could be secure and fulfill its
historical mission. And the 1960s, more than any other decade, seemed to
the young president to hold out the opportunities for doing so.</p>
<p>The first of the contingencies Kennedy had to deal with was the US
relationship to countries in the Third World. As a senator, Kennedy had
been an outspoken proponent of greater US engagement in the problems of
newly independent states and in opposing colonialism, for instance with
regard to Algeria. But his was not only an ideological and moral
engagement. He also feared that the United States was missing a trick by
not aligning more closely with the new states, and that the Soviets
capitalized on US inaction. He had read <em>The Stages of Economic Growth</em>,
by the MIT economic historian Walt Rostow, which argues that
"traditional" societies are particularly susceptible to Communist
infiltration at the very moment when they begin transitioning to
modernity. He also read Khrushchev's January 1961 speech, in which the
Soviet leader had pledged support even for non-Communist countries and
movements in the Third World, and commented on it extensively.
Reflecting his foreign policy inexperience, Kennedy saw the speech
almost as a declaration of war against the United States. He instructed
his advisers to "read, mark, learn and inwardly digest" Khrushchev's
message. "You've got to understand it...," the president kept repeating.
"This is our clue to the Soviet
Union."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en252en">^3^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en252}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-291}Kennedy believed that in order to win the
Cold War, the United States had to prevent the postcolonial states from
falling into the lap of the Soviet Union. Eisenhower had been too
passive in that regard, the new president thought. His administration
devised a policy that combined increased economic assistance with
training US and local troops in anti-insurgency warfare. US development
aid expenditure increased significantly, though only up to 0.6 percent
of GDP.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en253en">^4^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en253} A couple
of months into his presidency, Kennedy launched the US Peace Corps as
part of a larger effort to assist global development. The plan was to
recruit American youth to work as volunteers in Africa, Asia, or Latin
America, where they would provide skills training for the local
population. As much of what Kennedy proposed, the Peace Corps was a call
to action, an attempt at winning the Cold War by setting things right:
"Every young American who participates in the Peace Corps will know that
he or she is sharing in the great common task of bringing to man that
decent way of life which is the foundation of freedom and a condition of
peace."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en254en">^5^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en254} By 1966
fifteen thousand Americans were serving in countries as diverse as
Chile, Nigeria, Iran, and Thailand.</p>
<p>In security terms, Kennedy's initial focus was on southeast Asia, where
rebellions against US-supported regimes had been brewing since the
partition of Vietnam in 1954. The Laos crisis was to Kennedy a prime
example of the kind of challenges the Cold War would lead to in the
Third World. He viewed the Laotian Communists and their allies, the
North Vietnamese, the Chinese, and the Soviets, as launching a direct
provocation against him as a new president. It was a gauntlet thrown
down that Kennedy was only too eager to pick up. He told his advisers he
was "all for doing what we can in Laos," but he was very cautious about
introducing US ground troops, hoping to force the Communists into a
political settlement by threatening a US
intervention.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en255en">^6^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en255} As
part of this strategy, the White House authorized a CIA covert
operations program for Laos, which concentrated on the Chinese border
areas. Kennedy also dispatched the US Seventh Fleet to the South China
Sea and placed combat troops in Okinawa on alert. Later he sent US
troops to Thailand. Kennedy saw himself as threatening war in order to
achieve peace, a policy of brinkmanship that he would also use in more
serious conflicts during his presidency.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-292}In Laos, JFK's carrot and stick approach
worked, at least for a while. Khrushchev was in no mood for a battle
over Laos, which he regarded---with some right---as the periphery's
periphery. The Chinese were weakened after the disasters of the Great
Leap Forward, and those temporarily in control in Beijing---Liu Shaoqi
and Zhou Enlai---wanted to use the Laos crisis to indicate a continued
willingness to work with the Soviets in international affairs. The North
Vietnamese, although eager to help the Laotian radicals, were in no
position to act on their own. The result was a conference at Geneva, at
the end of which all powers involved---and the Laotians
themselves---agreed to a neutralization of Laos, and the establishment
of a coalition government. Very few people in Washington or Hanoi---and
nobody in Laos---thought this would be the end of the story, and Kennedy
deepened his commitment to South Vietnam as a result of the crisis. But,
for now, one ball in the Superpower contest had been put out of play.</p>
<p>Kennedy's visions for Europe were much more limited than those for the
Third World. He had no intention of attempting to change the balance of
power there, and he suspected that Khrushchev was reasonably happy, at
least for the time being, with current arrangements in Europe. The main
outstanding issue was the control of the divided German capital Berlin,
and Kennedy did not clearly understand how vexing this problem had
become for his Soviet counterpart. Khrushchev viewed Berlin---the only
part of Germany where people could still cross between East and
West---as a wound to the heart of the German Democratic Republic, the
eastern part of Germany, which was now a Communist state with 250,000
Red Army soldiers stationed within it. The problem was that East
Germans, especially those with education or specialist training,
continued to leave for the West in droves. In 1960 more than 190,000 had
sought more freedom and better income in the western half of the city.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-293}Both the East German leaders and members
of his own leadership had been asking Khrushchev what he intended to do
about the situation in Berlin. For the East German Communists, the
situation was untenable: not only were a lot of talented people leaving,
but their manner of leaving---in violation of controls and
orders---derided the authority of Walter Ulbricht and the East Berlin
government. But there was little they could do about it, as long as the
subway, for instance, ran unimpeded throughout the whole city. As
Ulbricht explained to Khrushchev in November 1960, "the situation in
Berlin has become complicated, not in our favor. West Berlin has
strengthened economically. This is seen in the fact that about 50,000
workers from East Berlin... go to work in West Berlin, since there are
higher salaries there. Why don't we raise our salaries?... First of all,
we don't have the means. Secondly, even if we raised their salary, we
could not satisfy their purchasing power with the goods that we have,
and they would buy things with that money in West
Berlin."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en256en">^7^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en256}
Khrushchev met with Kennedy for the first time in a summit in Vienna in
the summer of 1961. Kennedy had asked for the meeting. He told his
advisers that he wanted to show the Soviet leader that "we can be just
as tough as he
is."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en257en">^8^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en257} But their
talks did not go well. Khrushchev was in an ebullient mood, with traces
of distress. He was still upset over Lumumba's murder and the loss of
Soviet positions in Congo. But the Soviet Union had just put the first
man into space, and the United States had had its setbacks over Cuba and
in relations with its European allies. Unwisely, Khrushchev tried to
bully the much younger US president into making concessions. The Berlin
problem was foremost on his mind.</p>
<p>First Khrushchev treated Kennedy to a lesson in ideology. In accusing
the Soviet Union of promoting world revolution, he said, "the President
drew the wrong conclusion. He believes that when people rise against
tyrants, that is a result of Moscow's activities. This is not so.
Failure by the US to understand this generates danger. The USSR does not
foment revolution but the United States always looks for outside forces
whenever certain upheavals
occur."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en258en">^9^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en258} Turning
to Berlin, Khrushchev indicated that he was willing to negotiate, but at
the end of the year "the USSR will sign a peace treaty unilaterally and
all rights of access to Berlin will expire because the state of war will
cease to exist." Kennedy responded with equal bluntness: "The United
States cannot accept an ultimatum. Our leaving West Berlin would result
in the US becoming isolated." "The USSR will sign a peace treaty,"
Khrushchev said, "and the sovereignty of the GDR will be observed. Any
violation of that sovereignty will be regarded by the USSR as an act of
open aggression against a peace-loving country, with all the
consequences ensuing therefrom.... The USSR does not wish any change; it
merely wants to formalize the situation which has resulted from World
War II. The fact is that West Germany is in the Western group of nations
and the USSR recognizes this. East Germany is an ally of the socialist
countries and this should be recognized as a fait accompli." President
Kennedy "concluded the conversation by observing that it would be a cold
winter."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en259en">^10^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en259}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-294}"I never met a man like this," Kennedy
exclaimed wearily after his meeting with
Khrushchev.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en260en">^11^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en260} The
president found the Soviet leader overbearing, aggressive, but also
eager to avoid war and sensitive to matters of prestige. On returning to
the United States, Kennedy asked Congress for \$3.5 billion in extra
military expenditure in order to set up six new divisions for the army
and two for the marines. He also planned to triple the draft and to call
up the reserves. Khrushchev was fuming. "We helped elected Kennedy last
year," he boasted to a group of scientists as he stated his intention to
resume nuclear testing, which had been suspended by both countries since
1958. "Then we met with him in Vienna, a meeting that could have been a
turning point. But what does he say? 'Don't ask me for too much. Don't
put me in a bind. If I make too many concessions, I'll be turned out of
office.' Quite a guy! He comes to a meeting but can't perform. What the
hell do we need a guy like that for? Why waste time talking to
him?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en261en">^12^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en261}</p>
<p>Khrushchev's underestimation of Kennedy made him act on Berlin in ways
almost as self-defeating as Stalin's blockade in 1948. By the late
summer of 1961 both leaders had been able to talk themselves into crisis
mode over Germany. Neither side wanted military conflict, or even a
standoff. But Khrushchev had to solve the East German emigration problem
and Kennedy had to show his commitment to the West German government and
the NATO alliance. Khrushchev acted first. He picked up on a proposal
that Ulbricht had made earlier about building a wall in order to
physically separate East Berlin from West Berlin. Before signing off on
the project, the Soviet leader went on an incognito visit to the German
capital, driving into West Berlin, looking around. "I never got out of
the car," he remembered later, "but I made a full tour and saw what the
city was like."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en262en">^13^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en262}
On 13 August 1961, barbed wire started to go up along the dividing line
separating the two parts of Berlin. The subway tunnels were quickly
blocked off. The East German police shot at those who dared to cross.
The city of Berlin had again become a victim of the Cold War. And this
time its division seemed permanent.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-295}But erecting the Berlin Wall signaled East
Bloc weakness, not strength. The people of Berlin resisted as best they
could. "There was this one street we used to go to," one of them
remembers, "which was split down the middle by the wall. The street was
in the west but the houses were in the east. The soldiers bricked up the
front doors but people jumped out of the windows. There was a group of
us on the western side who used to all try to knock off the top level of
the wall before the cement had time to dry. We were a bit of a mob; we
would all surge together and smash
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en263en">^14^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en263} The mayor
of West Berlin, the Social-Democrat Willy Brandt, called the Wall "a
shocking injustice." But in his radio address to all Berliners, Brandt
also warned the East about the consequences:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
They have drawn through the heart of Berlin not just a border, but a
fence, as in a concentration camp. With the support of the East Bloc
states, the Ulbricht-regime has exacerbated the situation in Berlin and
again broken with legal agreements and humanitarian obligations. The
Senate of Berlin brings to the whole world its accusations against the
illegal and inhuman actions of those who divide Germany, oppress East
Berlin, and threaten West Berlin.... They will not succeed. We will in
the future bring even more people from all over the world to Berlin to
show them the cold, naked, and brutal reality of a system that has
promised people heaven on
earth.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en264en">^15^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en264}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-296}Khrushchev, however, thought he had found
a way of solving his Berlin problem without a direct confrontation with
the United States. He told his eastern European colleagues: "We should
not force the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, but continue to
move forward.... We should keep applying pressure.... We should carry on
salami tactics with regard to the rights of the Western countries.... We
have to pick our way through, divide them, exploit all the
possibilities."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en265en">^16^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en265}
Kennedy refused to let US forces leave Berlin and insisted on access to
East Berlin for American officers. For several months the Americans, the
Soviets, and the East Germans played cat and mouse all over Berlin.
Thirteen people were killed trying to leave the East right after the
Wall went up. One of them was the twenty-five-year-old Werner Probst,
who tried to swim across the Spree River. The East German border guards
shot him just as he grabbed hold of a ladder on the western side. Willy
Brandt ordered loudspeakers set up along the Wall, which kept repeating
that "anyone who shoots dead a person who wants to go from Germany to
Germany has committed murder. No one should think that he can claim to
have acted on orders when he is called to account one day. Murder is
murder, even if it has been
ordered."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en266en">^17^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en266} The
East responded by firing tear gas into the western sector.</p>
<p>For Kennedy and Khrushchev the situation remained tense for several
months. On 27 October there was a twenty-four-hour standoff between
Soviet and American tanks right at Checkpoint Charlie in
Friedrichstrasse, in the center of Berlin. It gradually became clear to
the White House that the Soviets would not attempt to force the
Americans out of Berlin, even as they tightened their grip on the city.
Kennedy immediately saw the immense propaganda value of the Wall, but
did not think there was much the United States could do about the
situation, except assuring Brandt, the West German government, and its
NATO allies that the United States would defend West Berlin in case of
an East Bloc attack. Privately, the president mused that "it's not a
very nice solution but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a
war."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en267en">^18^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en267} Brandt was
disgusted with what he saw as cowardice on the president's part and
feared for the future of his half-city. Other western European leaders,
especially France's de Gaulle, also saw Kennedy as weak. The German
people, de Gaulle said, "would be left with a sense of betrayal." He
"would not be party to such an arrangement. The Germans would then in
the future feel that at least they had one friend left in the
West."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en268en">^19^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en268}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-297}In spite of the criticism, it is hard to
see what more Kennedy could have done over Berlin except threatening
war. The president did not want to be pushed around by Khrushchev. But
Kennedy's view of what mattered in the Cold War was much more global
than that of his predecessors, and his reading of the Vienna summit was
that Khrushchev pushed on Berlin to solve East Germany's problems, not
because he planned to upset overall stability in Europe. Prestige
mattered to Kennedy, and it was at least as vital for him as for de
Gaulle to keep West Germany in NATO and forestall any temptation on the
side of the aging German chancellor Konrad Adenauer to negotiate
directly with the Soviets in order to achieve reunification in return
for German Cold War neutrality. But the walling off of East Berlin did
not upset the balance in Europe, Kennedy concluded, however shocking it
was in terms of human rights.</p>
<p>As could be expected from his thinking when he came into the presidency,
Kennedy's level-headedness applied much more to Europe than to the Third
World. His biggest challenge, by far, was to be the Cuban revolution, a
regional problem Eisenhower had been eager to deal with but which had
not been at the forefront of the general's mind. Gradually, Cuba was to
become a significant participant in the Cold War in its own right, as a
major Third World power and as an ally of the Soviet Union. But, as
Kennedy came into office, the question in Washington was how to handle
the Cuban revolution itself, an insurrection that had created a radical
and militant regime in the most populous country in the Caribbean,
ninety miles from the Florida coast.</p>
<p>The Cuban revolution was the result of years of misrule by Fulgencio
Batista, a populist president whose methods had become increasingly
dictatorial. It also reflected widespread poverty and social injustice
in the countryside, though not more than was found in other Latin
American countries. From the beginning, nationalist opposition to US
control played an important part in the revolution. Cuba had been
occupied by the United States several times during its history, and some
Cuban businesses, such the vital sugar industry, were dominated by US
companies. During the latter part of his regime, Batista had drawn
closer to the Americans, in part to offset his weaknesses at home. By
the late 1950s Cuba seemed a country ripe for political change.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-298}Those who came to fill this power gap were
Fidel Castro and his group of exiled revolutionaries from Cuba and other
Latin American countries. Castro was born in 1926, the son of a Spanish
immigrant who had become a wealthy farmer in Cuba. As a very young man,
Fidel Castro had become a radical student leader who opposed the
government, campaigned for social justice and Latin American solidarity,
and opposed US domination of Cuba. More of an insurrectionist than a
Communist, the imperious youth commented to a friend that he would only
become a Communist "if I could be
Stalin."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en269en">^20^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en269}
Castro's activities forced him into exile in Mexico in 1955, from where
he and a small band of revolutionaries attempted to return to Cuba
clandestinely the following year. Arriving in December 1956 in a leaky
yacht called <em>Granma</em>, bought from an American in Veracruz, only
nineteen revolutionaries made it inland. The survivors settled in the
Sierra Maestra, a mountain range in southeastern Cuba, where Castro, his
brother Raúl, and the Argentinian Communist Ernesto "Che" Guevara proved
themselves to be competent guerrilla leaders, skillfully setting up
campaigns against Batista's regime and recruiting adherents among local
peasants, workers on sugarcane plantations, and urban youth who traveled
to join them. In 1958, when the Batista regime started to get into real
trouble because of its economic incompetence, its internal divisions,
and clashes with the Eisenhower Administration, Castro's forces began
operating all over eastern Cuba. With his government collapsing around
him, Batista left the country with as much of his vast fortune as he
could grab. On 2 January 1959 the revolutionaries entered the capital,
Havana, in triumph.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-299}Their sudden victory came as much as a
surprise to Castro as to everyone else. Spectacularly unprepared for
government, the revolutionaries tried to draw on liberals and
anti-Batista professionals to help run their regime. Having himself been
drawn to Marxism, and influenced by his Communist brother Raúl, Castro
also began working with members of the Cuban Communist Party. Che
Guevara, who knew rather more about guerrilla tactics than economics,
was made head of the Central Bank. But there was no doubt who was in
charge, and who set the terms for the program of social change that was
initiated by the new government. Fidel Castro wanted to cleanse Cuba of
gambling, prostitution, and other ills that he saw as having been
brought in by the Americans. He decreed radical land reform, rent
reduction, and a minimum wage. He also set the new government to work on
massive plans for expansion of education and health care. High-ranking
members of the former regime were purged, and hundreds were executed by
firing squad after brief "revolutionary" trials. Fidel's regime was
authoritarian and at times brutal. A number of former allies broke with
him and went into exile. The Castro brothers and their adherents claimed
that the revolution needed to defend itself against its enemies.</p>
<p>The Eisenhower Administration was concerned about the radical and
authoritarian aspects of the new regime, and what they considered the
influence of Communists within it. But they also at first hoped that it
would be possible to stunt these trends over time. Featured on America's
most watched TV talk show right after the revolution, Castro, speaking
in English, made much of his Catholic upbringing and his interest in
baseball. In April 1959 he visited the United States and was feted as a
pop star by the press and by large audiences wherever he went. Speaking
to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, he encouraged US investment in Cuban
industries and promised tax breaks for American companies. "He insists,"
says one of the reports, "he's a good friend of this country. He claims,
in effect, he has only been pointing out past 'mistakes' in U.S. Policy
toward Cuba."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en270en">^21^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en270}
But as Castro's exiled adversaries began flying military missions into
his country from Florida airports and US public criticism of his
economic policies increased, the Cuban leader lost patience. In October
1959 he told a mass rally in Havana:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-300}There are immigrants from everywhere in
the United States.... And yet despite this Cuba is the only country
which is being attacked by émigré planes. Why Cuba? If there is one
country the United States should treat carefully, that country is Cuba.
Cuba has just suffered a two-year war during which its cities and fields
were bombed with American-made bombs, planes, and napalm. Thousands of
citizens were killed by weapons which came from the United States. The
least which we could expect after we destroyed the mercenary army, and
after we freed our people from the tyranny, is that our people not
continue to be bombed from bases on U.S.
territory.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en271en">^22^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en271}
:::</p>
<p>By 1960 the Cuban-US relationship was in free fall. Eisenhower wanted to
get rid of Castro, and ordered the CIA's agents to attempt to curtail
his power on Cuba. When Cuba nationalized the landholdings of US-owned
sugar cane companies, the United States responded by reducing the vital
import quota of Cuban sugar. Castro turned to the Soviet Union. His
increasing fondness for orthodox Marxism-Leninism would probably have
led him there anyhow, but strained relations with Washington helped him
on his way. In February 1960 Soviet deputy premier Anastas Mikoyan
visited Cuba, where he promised loans and signed an agreement in which
the USSR would supply Cuba with cheap oil in return for Cuban exports of
sugar. Mikoyan sent elated reports back to Moscow. "This is a real
revolution," he told the KGB man who accompanied him. "Just like ours. I
feel as though I have returned to my
youth!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en272en">^23^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en272} When the
US-owned refineries on Cuba refused to process Soviet oil, Castro
nationalized them. Eisenhower responded with an embargo on trade with
Cuba in October 1960. Castro then nationalized all remaining US property
on the island. In January 1961, just before leaving office, Eisenhower
broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-301}When Kennedy came in, he discovered that
Eisenhower had started an active covert operations program against Cuba
in March 1960, right after Mikoyan's visit. The CIA provided military
training for Cuban exiles and used its agents to sabotage arms shipments
and industry on the island. They also began plotting to assassinate
Fidel Castro, either by disaffected Cubans or by the help of US
gangsters, who had had their activities on the island scuttled by the
revolution. Eisenhower had not yet decided to go ahead with a full-scale
attempt at overthrowing Castro, though he was obviously tempted by an
operation similar to that which had overthrown Guatemalan president
Jacobo Arbenz in 1953. Kennedy was presented with the plans to invade as
if they were a fait accompli set up by the previous administration,
making it harder for the new president to move in a different direction
if he had so wanted.</p>
<p>In fact, there is almost no evidence that Kennedy wanted to act
differently on Cuba than the plans his predecessor had drawn up. During
the campaign, JFK had attacked Nixon (and implicitly Eisenhower) for
failing Cuba, both by supporting Batista's regime and by not "getting
results" against the Communists. "We never were on the side of freedom;
we never used our influence when we could have used it most
effectively---and today Cuba is lost for freedom," candidate Kennedy had
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en273en">^24^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en273} Both the
military and the CIA recommended the invasion plan, and showed their
willingness to amend it when President Kennedy indicated that he wanted
there to be less visible evidence of a US involvement. Kennedy generally
admired the intelligence community for its versatility and intellectual
acumen, and had kept Eisenhower's director of central intelligence,
Allen Dulles, in place in the new administration. "If I need some
material fast or an idea fast, CIA is the place I have to go. The State
Department is four or five days to answer a simple yes or no," Kennedy
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en274en">^25^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en274}</p>
<p>The plan that was implemented on 17 April 1961 was a failure from the
beginning. Caught between his eagerness to remove Castro and his desire
for deniability of direct US participation, Kennedy helped send 1,400
US-trained counterrevolutionary Cuban fighters across to the island from
Guatemala. But, with the exception of bombing raids by US aircraft
piloted by Cuban exiles, the president did not authorize US air support.
There was no Cuban political organization to take charge of the
operation. The CIA had expected that Kennedy would approve direct US
involvement if the landings went badly. But JFK did no such thing.
Instead, the invaders at Bahía de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs), 150 miles from
Havana, were rounded up by Cuban troops, paraded on TV, and sent off to
prison camps. Meeting with his new prisoners, Castro told them that "the
people want the execution of all invaders.... It would be easy to
execute you but it would only lessen our victory. The least guilty would
pay for the most
guilty."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en275en">^26^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en275}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-302}For the revolutionaries, the failed Bay of
Pigs invasion opened up new opportunities. Meeting with US
representatives that summer, Che Guevara said "that he wanted to thank
us [the United States] very much for the invasion---that it had been a
great political victory for them---enabled them to consolidate---and
transformed them from an aggrieved little country to an
equal."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en276en">^27^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en276} Fidel
Castro knew that the threat was not over. But he also knew that he could
now be much more outspoken about his preferences and his international
affiliations. "The danger of direct aggression could again gain momentum
following this failure," he told the Cubans in a radio address. "We have
said that imperialism will disappear. We do not wish it to commit
suicide; we want it to die a natural death.... But their system demands
production for war, not peace. How different from the Soviet
Union..."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en277en">^28^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en277}</p>
<p>While Castro used the Bay of Pigs to get closer to the Soviets, both in
terms of industry and security, Kennedy had his own lessons. "Five
minutes after it began to fall in, we all looked at each other and
asked, 'How could we have been so stupid?'" the president told a friend.
"When we saw the wide range of the failures we asked ourselves why it
had not been apparent to somebody from the start. I guess you get walled
off from reality when you want something to succeed too
much."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en278en">^29^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en278} Robert
Kennedy, the president's brother, whom he had appointed
attorney-general, pushed for further action to overthrow Castro.
"Serious attention must be given to this problem immediately and not
wait for the situation in Cuba to revert back to a time of relative
peace and calm with the U.S. having been beaten off with her tail
between her legs," Bobby Kennedy exhorted his brother. "The time has
come for a showdown for in a year or two years the situation will be
vastly worse. If we don't want Russia to set up missile bases in Cuba,
we had better decide now what we are willing to do to stop
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en279en">^30^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en279}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-303}Besides the gradual slide into the Vietnam
War, the Bay of Pigs invasion was the biggest mistake of JFK's
presidency. It solidified the Castro regime beyond anything Castro
himself could have done, and was to lead to Kennedy's most dangerous
confrontation with the Soviet Union. Part of Kennedy's problem was in
terms of priorities. He felt that there were many challenges left over
from the previous administration, and that he would have to deal with a
great number of them at the start of his presidency.</p>
<p>One key issue, which preoccupied the young president much, was the
extraordinary growth in the nuclear weapons arsenals of both
Superpowers. Not only had the number of US nuclear warheads increased
more than ten-fold over ten years, but by 1962 the Soviets had their own
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), though considerably fewer
than Kennedy had claimed they had during his presidential campaign.
Khrushchev commanded about one hundred missiles that could possibly
reach the continental United States. Of these around thirty were based
on Soviet submarines. Given the overwhelming preponderance of US ICBMs,
plus shorter-range nuclear missiles placed around the Soviet Union from
Greenland via Germany and Turkey to South Korea, and an estimated 144
nuclear submarines, Kennedy may not have had that much to worry about.
But his concerns were increasingly with US strategic planning, which
assumed that any war with the USSR would necessarily escalate into a
full-scale nuclear conflict.</p>
<p>Kennedy wanted to move away from Eisenhower's reliance on the threat of
massive nuclear retaliation to deter the Soviets. He wanted a more
flexible response, a strategy outlined by his secretary of defense,
Robert McNamara, as consisting of three parts, at least as far as Europe
was concerned, in the event of war. First, an attempt to repulse Warsaw
Pact forces by conventional (non-nuclear) means. If that failed, as
McNamara assumed it would because of the Soviet conventional superiority
in Europe, the United States would use smaller, tactical nuclear
weapons. Only as a last resort would the Americans respond with an
all-out nuclear attack on Soviet cities and military bases. The Kennedy
Administration developed the Single Integrated Operational Plan, known
as SIOP, which assumed that mutually assured destruction was not the
only possible outcome in case of war.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-304}Khrushchev was well aware of US strategic
superiority in nuclear terms. His response was to combine bluffing and a
war of nerves. The Soviets consistently claimed to have a greater
nuclear capability than they actually possessed, and attempted to make
up for what they lacked in precision and ballistic expertise by
developing ever bigger nuclear weapons. The AN602 hydrogen bomb---the
so-called <em>Tsar Bomba</em> or Emperor of Bombs---which the Soviets tested in
October 1961, is the largest nuclear weapon ever produced, with an
explosive power of about 1,500 times the combined yield of the weapons
that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or ten times the combined
explosive power of all other weapons used during World War II.
Khrushchev did not mind that <em>Tsar Bomba</em> was virtually undeployable for
any practical military purpose. "I think the people with the strongest
nerves will be the winners," he said. "That is the most important
consideration in the power struggle of our time. The people with weak
nerves will go to the
wall."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en280en">^31^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en280}</p>
<p>In April 1962 Khrushchev had an idea. Frustrated over events in Germany,
angry with the Chinese who mocked him for his circumspection, and
convinced that Kennedy was irresolute but also increasingly
anti-Communist, Khrushchev wanted to act decisively to save the Cuban
revolution. What if, he suggested to a somewhat incredulous Mikoyan, the
Soviet Union were to deploy nuclear missiles on Cuba "very
speedily"?<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en281en">^32^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en281} The
United States had placed its nukes in Turkey, close to the Soviet
border. Why could his country not guarantee Castro's survival by sending
its own weapons to the island? There was, Khrushchev argued, no other
way Havana could be protected---it was too close to the United States
for the Soviets to be able to stave off an invasion by conventional
means.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-305}Having secured the Moscow leadership's
approval, Castro was consulted, though in a form that made Khrushchev's
plans almost into a done deal. Castro at first doubted the wisdom of
provoking the Americans further, and worried about the reaction of other
Latin American countries. But he was also pleased that the Soviets put
such emphasis on Cuba and was ready to act "in solidarity" with his new
comrades in Moscow. The plans went ahead. The first Soviet military
personnel arrived, under great secrecy, in July 1962. Missiles began
arriving in early September. At their peak more than forty thousand
Soviets were building missile sites both for defensive and offensive
purposes. The largest nuclear missiles that became functional on Cuba in
October 1962 had a maximum radius of 1,200 miles, enough to reach cities
in the southern and eastern United States from Houston to Baltimore.</p>
<p>Both the US military and the CIA had begun suspecting that the Soviets
contemplated placing missiles on Cuba well before the summer of 1962.
But when challenged on the issue, Soviet diplomats had been instructed
to lie. In mid-October a US spy plane, a U-2, overflew the island and
came back with clear evidence of missile sites under construction. The
president, when alerted, wanted time to consider the US response. From
the start of the crisis, Kennedy was certain that he had to get any
Soviet missiles out of Cuba. The question was how to do that and avoid
an all-out nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union. When
Kennedy saw Soviet foreign minister Anatolii Gromyko in the White House
for a prearranged meeting on 18 October, Gromyko again lied about the
Soviet deployment. The USSR "pursued solely the purpose of contributing
to the defense capabilities of Cuba," Gromyko
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en282en">^33^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en282}</p>
<p>Gromyko's bold-faced lie convinced Kennedy that he had to go public. In
a radio and television speech to the American people on 22 October,
Kennedy addressed what he saw as an immediate danger emanating from
Cuba. "Within the past week," the president said, "unmistakable evidence
has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now
in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can
be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the
Western Hemisphere.... The 1930s taught us a clear lesson: aggressive
conduct, if allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads
to war." His "unswerving objective," Kennedy said, was to "prevent the
use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure
their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere." With the
crisis now out in the open, Kennedy had put his credibility on the line:
"I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine,
reckless and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations
between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this course
of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the
perilous arms race and to transform the history of man. He has an
opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of
destruction."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en283en">^34^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en283}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-306}Behind closed doors, attitudes hardened.
In his speech, Kennedy had announced what he called a "quarantine" on
shipments of weapons to Cuba. He also announced increased surveillance
of the island, indicating that any attempts to prevent US violations of
Cuban airspace would be regarded as an act of war. Neither Kennedy nor
anyone in the so-called Executive Committee (ExComm) of top advisers
that he had set up to deal with the crisis understood the Soviet
dedication to defend the Cuban revolution or, for that matter, Cuba's
need to defend its own sovereignty. The president and all of Washington
viewed Soviet actions as preparations for an attack on the United States
and a means through which (legitimate) US control of the Western
Hemisphere could be thwarted. At the start of the crisis, they would
rather risk war than accept compromise.</p>
<p>Kennedy's main strength throughout the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 was
that, in spite of his hard line overall, he still gave diplomacy a
chance. As the world held its breath on 23 October, waiting to see what
would happen when Soviet ships bound for Cuba were intercepted by the US
Navy, Kennedy secretly explored how the crisis could be resolved and
nuclear war avoided. On the one hand, he needed to stave off hotheads on
his own side who wanted to launch immediate airstrikes to disable the
Soviet missiles on Cuba. Such an attack, Kennedy knew, would mean global
nuclear war against the Soviet Union. On the other, he had to find a
solution that removed the missiles and made the United States the
winner. When Khrushchev, himself under pressure to avoid a
confrontation, turned the Soviet ships back, the president thought he
had made a breakthrough.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-307}But Khrushchev had no intention of backing
down. Like Kennedy, he needed breathing space, but he also sent a
message to the president in which he rejected all of his demands and
condemned the illegal US blockade of Cuba. Soviet and US military forces
worldwide were put on full combat readiness. At the UN, US ambassador
Adlai Stevenson confronted his Soviet counterpart, Valerii Zorin:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
<strong>S[TEVENSON:]{.small-caps}</strong> All right sir, let me ask you one simple
question: Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the USSR has placed and is
placing medium- and intermediate-range missiles and sites in Cuba? Yes
or no? Don't wait for the translation: Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>Z[ORIN:]{.small-caps}</strong> I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and
therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the
fashion in which a prosecutor does. In due course, sir, you will have
your reply.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en284en">^35^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en284}
:::</p>
<p>Toward the end of the second week of the crisis, the buildup of US
invasion forces against Cuba continued in Florida and along the Gulf
coast. US overflights of Cuba intensified. Panic began to spread in US
cities and elsewhere in the world, even in the Soviet Union, where the
authorities tried to prevent news about the crisis getting to the
population. Walter Cronkite, the CBS anchorman who reported on the
crisis from minute to minute, began wondering what he would do in the TV
studio when nuclear war broke out: "We have a utility room where the
furnaces are, and we wondered whether we could make that into a bomb
shelter of some form. We were learning for the first time the time that
we would have after the explosion, before the fumes... [and the] heat
would reach us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en285en">^36^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en285}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-308}On 27 October an American U-2 overflying
Cuba was shot down by a Soviet missile. Everyone involved thought war
was getting very close. Castro wrote what sounded like a farewell letter
to Khrushchev, where he urged him to launch a nuclear first strike
against the United States after the Americans had begun invading Cuba.
"I believe that the imperialists' aggressiveness makes them extremely
dangerous, and that if they manage to carry out an invasion of Cuba...
then that would be the moment to eliminate this danger forever, in an
act of the most legitimate self-defense. However harsh and terrible the
solution, there would be no
other."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en286en">^37^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en286}</p>
<p>But Kennedy was still playing for time. Contrary to orders issued
earlier, he refused to permit the US Air Force to destroy the Soviet
missile site that had shot down the U-2. Most of the ExComm members had
not left the White House in a week. That evening Kennedy sent them home.
McNamara remembered later: "It was a perfectly beautiful night, as fall
nights are in Washington. I walked out of the president's Oval Office,
and as I walked out, I thought I might never live to see another
Saturday night."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en287en">^38^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en287}
Meanwhile, the same evening, Robert Kennedy met secretly with the Soviet
ambassador to the United States, Anatolii Dobrynin. He offered a US
pledge not to invade Cuba and an eventual removal of American missiles
in Turkey in return for the Soviet withdrawal of all its missiles.
Khrushchev, who knew the world was teetering on the brink of war,
decided to accept. Conscious that time was running out, he had his
acceptance read out on the open airwaves of Radio Moscow. He even had
the broadcast repeated twice. On the morning of 28 October the immediate
crisis was over.</p>
<p>The Cuban missile crisis was the most dangerous nuclear confrontation
between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War
(though not the only one). Historians have been battling over who won
and who lost. The real answer is, of course, that everyone won, since
nuclear war was avoided. But it is also clear that, by being forced to
take his missiles out of Cuba in such an open and visible fashion,
Khrushchev lost the most. Why did he back down? He knew that the Soviet
Union would suffer the most in case of a nuclear war, since its ability
to inflict damage on the United States was far inferior to the reverse.
He also feared for the survival of his regime in case of war. But the
real reason was probably his Marxism. Khrushchev believed that Communism
was on the up worldwide, and that his historic role was to steer the
Soviet Union through a period in which, through the laws of history
itself, the global balance of forces tipped in its direction. Nuclear
war would destroy this historical achievement. Khrushchev wanted to
celebrate the triumph of Communism, not eulogize at its funeral pyre.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-309}Throughout the crisis, President Kennedy
had proven himself to be a skillful leader and diplomat. He had taken
great risks, and if Khrushchev had not backed down, it is likely that he
would have taken his country into a nuclear war. But the risks he took
were risks that most Americans seemed willing to take in order to
preserve their increasingly global predominance. John Kennedy played the
missile crisis well because he was broadly in line with the attitudes of
those who had elected him, but also because he added to that the vital
instruments of diplomacy, open and secret. It was through these
instruments that a "solution"---fickle, incomplete, and tenuous---was in
the end found.</p>
<p>According to his own testimony, Fidel Castro was furious. "We were
irate. How did we learn about this? Through the radio, on the morning of
the 28th. They broadcast that an agreement had been reached between the
Soviet Union and the United States, that Kennedy was offering Khrushchev
a guarantee. It really was a disgraceful agreement. It never crossed my
mind they would do anything like
this."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en288en">^39^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en288} For the
Cuban leader, it would have been better to die with honor than to live
with disgrace. His relationship with the Soviets would never be the
same, even though the countries remained close allies for the rest of
the Cold War.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en289en">^40^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en289}</p>
<p>John Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. He was forty-six years
old. If he had lived and been reelected in 1964, could he have been the
president who brought the Cold War to an end? There is very little
evidence for that, even though it was a more concerned and careful
Kennedy who returned to his foreign policy agenda after October 1962.
Still, his aim was to win the Cold War, even if he had to do so while
avoiding crises that could lead to an all-out conflict. Kennedy
continued to believe that the Soviet Union constituted a global
challenge to American interests, and that the United States had to push
back when challenged. Reflecting on the missile crisis in a public
speech a year later, the president said that he was "hoping for steady
progress toward less critically dangerous relations with the Soviets,
but never laboring under any illusions about Communist methods or
Communist
goals."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en290en">^41^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en290}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-310}One key change revealed by the crisis was
just how much two sides knew about each other, both through espionage
and through open sources. Spying had always played a key role in the
Cold War, but in the 1960s and '70s it took on a new significance. In
the immediate post-1945 era, the Soviets had had the main successes.
Klaus Fuchs and other atomic spies had given Stalin what he needed to
know about the US nuclear programs. Britain's Foreign Office had been
utterly compromised when it had become clear, in 1951, that the head of
its American Department, Donald Maclean, was a Soviet spy. Maclean
escaped to Moscow, as did other members of the Cambridge Five spy ring
that he belonged to, including Kim Philby, who had been the main British
intelligence liaison with the United States. It is hard to imagine a
greater disaster in intelligence terms.</p>
<p>In the 1960s the balance of spying power started to change. One possible
reason was that the Soviet Union, post-Hungary, had lost some of its
attraction to educated people in the West, making it harder to recruit
ideologically minded spies. At the same time both western Europe and the
United States seemed to be better able to deal with issues of social
inequity than before: people like Fuchs and Maclean had been recruited
to serve the Soviets in the 1930s in part because of their distaste for
exploitative capitalism. In the 1960s, however, the most important spies
were Soviets fed up with their own society. Anatolii Golitsyn, Oleg
Penkovskii, Dmitrii Poliakov, and other Soviet intelligence officers who
gave crucial information to the West all explained that they wanted the
West to win the Cold War. Penkovskii explained that he saw himself as a
"warrior for the cause of truth, for the ideals of a truly free world
and of democracy.... I wish to make my contribution, perhaps a modest
one but in my view an important one, to our mutual
cause."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en291en">^42^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en291}
Poliakov, who ended up as a GRU major general, was, according to his
American handler, "our crown jewel,... the best source at least to my
knowledge that American intelligence has ever had and, I would
submit,... the best source that any intelligence service has ever
had."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en292en">^43^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en292}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter011.xhtml#page-311}In spite of the advantages he had gained
on his opponents, JFK's last year in office was taken by responding to
domestic political crises, such as the growing African-American civil
rights movement, by the widening war in Vietnam, and by attempts at
finding some form of lasting stability in relations with the Soviet
Union. He and Khrushchev agreed on a limited test ban treaty for nuclear
weapons; a small step, granted, and one the Chinese felt was exclusively
directed against them, since they were about to test their own first
weapon. Even so, it was a sign that there were some matters on which the
United States and the USSR could agree. Like Eisenhower, Kennedy
regarded the Chinese Communists as being even more unreasonable than
their Soviet brethren. In January 1963 he explained to the National
Security Council that he thought the Chinese would be "our major
antagonists of the late '60s and
beyond."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en293en">^44^</a>{#chapter011.xhtml#en293}</p>
<p>Were the Berlin and Cuban crises Cold War watersheds? Some say they
were: the former in the sense that the European Cold War had now visibly
stabilized, and the latter because both Americans and Soviets saw the
necessity of some form of detente, or at least the need to avoid extreme
nuclear crises in the future. But it did not necessarily look that way
in the early 1960s: the Cold War continued and new crises could occur at
any moment, though it was becoming increasingly likely that they would
take place in the Third World and not in Europe. During Kennedy's time
in office, the Cold War was becoming truly global, and the burdens it
put on the material and mental resources of its main protagonists
increased relentlessly.

<h1 id="encountering-vietnam-chapter-title"><a href="#toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012">Encountering Vietnam</a> {.chapter-title}</h1>
<p>The Vietnamese revolution started as a revolt against colonial
oppression and ended as a set of wars deeply enmeshed with the global
Cold War. Its origins were in the French colonization of Indochina in
the nineteenth century, or perhaps even further back in Vietnam's long
years of Chinese domination. At the core of the enterprise was a group
of Vietnamese nationalist revolutionaries who in their youth became
committed Marxists and admirers of the Soviet experience. For these
young men and women, nationalism and Marxism were one. They believed
that only by developing their movement, their nation, and their state
according to Marxist laws of evolution could Vietnam truly succeed in
the modern world. Their program was long-term, expansive, and utopian,
but its implementation was dependent on first achieving independence and
national unity. And it was for these latter aims that almost three
million Vietnamese fought and died during the twentieth
century.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en294en">^1^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en294}</p>
<p>Although policy-makers worldwide did not see it at the time, Vietnam was
in many ways different from the rest of Asia. It was the only place
where Communism became a dominant outlet for nationalism almost from the
beginning. Even in countries where the Communist movement grew very big,
such as in China, Korea, or Indonesia, this was a much more gradual
phenomenon and the rivals for power were stronger. But in Vietnam, the
Communists' opponents were tainted by their collaboration with the
French, and Ho Chi Minh could present his Viet Minh movement as
authentically Vietnamese both culturally and politically. Irrespective
of his long service as a Comintern agent, Ho reinvented himself after
1945 as the symbol of national independence and as an elder of his
people who deserved respect, almost veneration, by all Vietnamese.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-314}The US war in Vietnam was therefore folly
from the beginning. Not because there were no anti-Communist Vietnamese
who were willing to fight for their cause, but because they were a
minority and were bound to lose out in any contest for nationalist
authenticity. The Vietnamese Communists could also count on the
assistance of the Communist Chinese next door and on Soviet help. But
successive American Administrations believed that the United States had
to act to avoid a Communist victory in Indochina. The domino theory,
first invented for China, was moved to Vietnam. To them, the Cold War
was a zero-sum game, in which a loss for one side was a gain for the
other. And the Soviet Union, or, even worse, China, was seen as
controlling Vietnamese Communism and standing to gain through its
success.</p>
<p><strong>I[NSIDE]{.small-caps} V[IETNAM THINGS]{.small-caps}</strong> looked rather
different. For Ho Chi Minh and those who had worked with him in the
Communist movement of Vietnam since the 1920s, the 1954 Geneva
Conference had been a disaster. Instead of getting the united, socialist
Vietnam that they had fought for---and believed they had gained through
their prowess on the battlefield---they received only half a country,
and uncertain prospects of reunification anytime soon. And even worse:
Moscow and Beijing, their two main foreign sponsors, had together forced
them to accept this division. Although Hanoi was told that this was a
temporary "consolidation" of revolutionary gains, no Vietnamese
Communist was in any doubt that their country's unity had been
sacrificed on the altar of Great Power politics. But the leaders also
knew that they stood no chance of fighting on their own against the new
regime in the south and its American backers. Ho Chi Minh was convinced
that reunification would take time. First, Communist North Vietnam had
to build a state, refine its army, and build strong links with its
Communist allies. Ho was under strong pressure from younger leaders, and
especially those who themselves came from the south, for a more activist
policy. He was a symbol rather than a state-builder; his power receded,
and impatience grew, as North Vietnam developed in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-315}The North Vietnamese state, called the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was Communist from the very beginning.
In 1951 Ho Chi Minh had set up the Vietnam Workers' Party (VWP) to act
as a Communist core within the Viet Minh front. From the Geneva Accords
of 1954 on, the VWP was in charge of building the state, and the state
it built north of the seventeenth parallel was a copy of the Soviet
model as implemented in China after 1949. It controlled the army, the
police, and had a large network of informers and political enforcers all
over the country (including in large parts of the south). It imprisoned
its opponents in labor camps of the Stalin type. Around fifteen thousand
were executed, most of them during a hastily carried out land reform
campaign patterned on China's. At least a million people fled to the
south. Even the Soviets and the Chinese criticized the North Vietnamese
for having gone too far too fast.</p>
<p>But the trouble the Vietnamese Communists put themselves in was overcome
through cloaking it in a mantle of nationalism. All that was done, Ho
declared, was done for the best of the nation, to make it rich, strong,
and unified. Communist propaganda, both in the north and the south,
hammered in the nationalist credentials of the Hanoi government and,
equally importantly, the southern government's lack of them. Leaders in
Hanoi remained convinced, probably correctly, that they would "win" an
all-Vietnam election if one were to be held, which was the reason why
the Eisenhower Administration opposed such elections, in spite of the
Geneva Accords. By 1957 it was clear that national elections were an
unlikely prospect, and that both the Soviets and the Americans easily
accepted the status quo for Vietnam and the rest of Indochina. With his
peace offensive underway, the last thing Khrushchev wanted was another
Asian war.</p>
<p>The Americans, however, did have the problem of what to do with southern
Vietnam. The French were gone, relieved to depart after their military
humiliation. The former emperor, Bao Dai, was tainted by collaboration
both with the French and the Japanese. Jointly, the emperor and his US
advisers settled on Ngo Dinh Diem as prime minister. Diem was a
Vietnamese nationalist who opposed the Viet Minh and who had been in
exile, mostly in the United States, since 1950. His politics were
nativist, Catholic, and conservative: Diem believed that in order to
make Vietnam into the great power it deserved to be, it had to return to
its traditional roots in a new and invigorated Catholic form. His new
Vietnam was to be modern, along the patterns set by the West, but would
also make use of the unique abilities the Vietnamese had to create a
just and stable society. Soon Diem had pushed the emperor aside and set
up a Republic of Vietnam in the south with himself as president. The
United States began pouring significant aid into the new South
Vietnamese state, but the reforms Diem had promised were slow in coming.
His main aim was to solidify his own regime against all comers,
including the Communists who remained in the south.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-316}Irrespective of the advice from their
international partners, the Vietnamese Communists slowly began to extend
their campaigns against Diem's regime in the south. In 1956, encouraged
by Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and insistence that each party had to
find its own road to socialism, the southern Vietnamese Communist Le
Duan composed a masterful manifesto of doublespeak. In it, he insisted
on the correctness of the Soviet view that "all conflicts in the world
at present can be resolved by peaceful means." But he also warned that,
in the south, a "people's revolutionary movement definitely will rise
up." In other words, the Communist party had to support the spontaneous
mass movement in the south, shape it, and lead
it.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en295en">^2^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en295} By 1957, in
response to Diem's attempts at wiping out Communism in the south, the
party began a campaign of assassinations and bombings. Le Duan was made
head of the party, gradually replacing Ho Chi Minh as the real center of
power. In January 1959 the VWP approved of a "people's war" in the south
and began infiltrating cadres into the south through Laos, along what
became known as the "Ho Chi Minh trail." In July 1959 the southern
Communists killed two US military advisers just outside the southern
capital of Saigon. They were the first Americans to die in the new war
in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-317}The reason why Hanoi in 1960 could
organize a general rebellion against Diem's government was the
Sino-Soviet split. The Vietnamese skillfully began playing their two
sponsors against each other in order to get the support they needed.
There is little doubt that Le Duan and his leadership group were
considerably closer to the Chinese than to the Soviets in terms of
ideology, and that Mao's increasing radicalism inspired them to act
forcefully. But Khrushchev was not just brought along by competition and
circumstance. Because of Cuba, Algeria, and Congo, by 1960 the Soviets
were much more alert to the potential for gains through "wars of
national liberation" than they had been only a few years earlier.
Hanoi's timing of a rebellion in the south was therefore close to
perfect, even though neither Le Duan nor his foreign sponsors at this
point expected anything but a long, drawn-out struggle with an uncertain
outcome.</p>
<p>John Kennedy inherited his Vietnam quandary from President Eisenhower,
and he never had time or occasion to concentrate on it to the extent of
finding a firm strategy. Instead, Kennedy's Vietnam policy became a
gradual slide toward greater US involvement, even though JFK resisted
sending regular US troops to Indochina. He participated in negotiations
for a neutralization of Laos, which gave some semblance of stability to
the region. But Kennedy's greatest entanglement, in line with his
overall approach to the Third World, was through attempts at reforming
the South Vietnamese state and improving the fighting capacity of its
army and air force. By 1963 the United States had sixteen thousand
advisers in South Vietnam, up from six hundred when Kennedy took over.
All main Vietnamese military units had US officers attached to them, and
although the US advisers were not supposed to participate directly in
fighting against Hanoi or the Communist-controlled National Liberation
Front (NLF) in the south, they became increasingly indispensable to the
South Vietnamese war effort. US aircraft and helicopters transported
Vietnamese troops, including on raids into North Vietnam. The Americans
also started using herbicides for crop destruction in order to starve
the South Vietnamese rebels and their supporters, and began setting up
"strategic villages" to which peasants "rescued" from NLF control could
be relocated.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-318}In spite of the increasing US support, by
1963 it was clear that the Diem regime was in serious trouble. Not only
did the NLF expand its operations, especially in areas around the
southern capital, Saigon. But the South Vietnamese president also
clashed with the non-Communist political opposition, Buddhist groups,
and student organizations. His relationship with his US sponsors also
deteriorated; Diem insisted that South Vietnam was a sovereign country,
and that he was ultimately in control of civilian and military planning.
A number of Buddhist monks self-immolated on the streets of Saigon in
protest against the regime, and their burning bodies were shown on US
television news, making many Americans wonder about the success of the
US involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, the Kennedy Administration
quietly encouraged South Vietnamese generals to carry out a coup against
Diem. On 1 November 1963 the South Vietnamese president was kidnapped
and murdered by his own officers. Three weeks later Kennedy was shot in
Dallas.</p>
<p>Kennedy's biggest mistake on Vietnam was always to view the south and
the north as two different countries. From this followed that the
northern military involvement in the south was an invasion, and that the
Communist great powers---and China especially---were behind the
aggression. This line of thinking, which the new president, Lyndon B.
Johnson, took over from Kennedy, linked the Vietnam War directly to the
Cold War. It also drew connections back to Korea, the Chinese civil war,
and ultimately World War II. The lesson was supposed to be that if the
United States did not stand up to Communist aggression, then its resolve
would be doubted and its positions, including its ideological positions,
eroded. But both Kennedy and Johnson believed that US Administrations,
and especially Democratic Administrations, that were not seen to stand
up to Communist aggression were punished by opinion-makers and voters.
Both Kennedy and Johnson, in very different ways, had a great fear of
weakness. Quoting friends from his home state of Texas, Johnson liked to
say that Americans "will forgive you for anything except being
weak."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en296en">^3^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en296}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-319}In domestic terms, Lyndon Johnson was one
of the best prepared presidents the United States has ever had. He had
been in Congress since 1937 and was known as the master of the Senate,
where he as majority leader had championed progressive causes in the FDR
mold. As Kennedy's vice president he had served unhappily at the margins
of power. With the president's assassination, he was thrown into the top
seat of American politics, and he had a set of reforms that he wanted to
carry out almost from the beginning. Some were plans that had been
developed in the Kennedy Administration. But most were Johnson's own
causes, and he had the experience, the toughness, and the wherewithal to
push them through. Perhaps the most successful president in legislative
terms in US history, Johnson saw through major initiatives on poverty
reduction, civil rights, and health care, as well as immigration and
education reform, dealing with thorny issues that had eluded his
predecessor (or, for that matter, his successors). In the 1964
presidential elections, he crushed his Republican opponent and was
reelected with the highest percentage of the popular vote ever.</p>
<p>But a solution to the escalating war in Vietnam seemed to elude Johnson,
too. Although his political instincts told him to find a way out as fast
as possible, he feared the consequences. His priorities were his
domestic reforms, but he felt he would be unable to carry those out
fully if he did not have a clean sheet on foreign policy. Discussing how
to present the war to the American people, Johnson confided to an old
buddy in the Senate:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
I think that I've got to say that I didn't get you in here, but we're in
here by treaty [with South Vietnam] and our national honor's at stake.
And if this treaty is no good, none of 'em are any good. Therefore we're
there. And being there, we've got to conduct ourselves like men. That's
number one. Number two, in our own revolution, we wanted freedom and we
naturally look with sympathy with other people who want freedom and if
you leave 'em alone and give 'em freedom, we'll get out
tomorrow.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en297en">^4^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en297}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-320}During 1964 the Johnson Administration
became increasingly convinced that the United States faced an all-out
challenge from the Communist camp in Vietnam. The coup against Diem had
led to little but increased instability. The rebellion in the Republic
of Vietnam continued to spread. The evidence of the north supplying and
directing that rebellion continued to mount. And behind Hanoi stood
Beijing and Moscow, more or less in that order. Against plentiful
evidence of a growing Sino-Soviet split, Johnson kept focusing on
Vietnam as a Communist bloc problem. The difference between the
Communist great powers, according to the Johnson Administration, was
that the Soviets were practical and rational, while the Chinese were
unreasonable and increasingly irrational. It is not difficult to see
racial stereotypes behind this kind of thinking: the Soviets, after all,
were at least led by Europeans, while the Chinese were Orientals who did
not understand---or did not want to engage in---the normal give and take
among powers. It was this irrationality more than anything, Johnson's
secretary of defense Robert McNamara believed, that kept the war going.</p>
<p>By mid-1964, the president had become convinced that the only way to win
the war in Vietnam was by showing an on the ground military willingness
to do so. If the United States proved to Hanoi and to Moscow that they
had nothing to gain by further aggression, they would come to the
negotiating table, irrespective of howls of protest from the Chinese.
McNamara and McGeorge Bundy, the president's national security adviser,
both pushed for the bombing of North Vietnam, the deployment of US
ground forces, and the widening of US participation in the war alongside
South Vietnamese troops. In a draft presidential speech, Bundy argued
that the United States was not "bound to give the aggressors any
guarantee against joint and necessary reprisal for their repeated acts
of war against free men in South Vietnam. What has been ordered from
outside South Vietnam can be punished outside South Vietnam, by all the
laws of nations, and by the elemental rule that men are answerable for
what is done at their command. The aggressor in Hanoi knows his guilt,
and the world knows it
too."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en298en">^5^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en298} Even
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a relative dove on foreign affairs,
prodded the president. "The matter of war and peace lay in the Pacific,"
he told Johnson. "If we appeared to falter before the Soviet Union and
Communist China this would be interpreted as a reward for the track they
have been following, and this would increase the chance of war. If we
were to make a move that would signal to Peiping [Beijing] that we are
weakening, this would increase our
danger."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en299en">^6^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en299}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-321}In August 1964 Johnson used inaccurate
reports of North Vietnamese vessels firing on a US naval ship in
international waters as an excuse to get Congressional authority for
widening the war. The so-called Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized the
president "to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack
against the forces of the United States and to prevent further
aggression."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en300en">^7^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en300} In
1965 the US Air Force started bombing raids into North Vietnam, and the
number of US troops increased to almost two hundred thousand. By the end
of the year almost two thousand Americans had died in the fighting, and
it was becoming clear to most people at home that this was a real war
and not the kind of proxy conflict that the United States had engaged in
globally over the past decade.</p>
<p>We know today that many of the US assumptions about the political and
military calculus on the North Vietnamese, Soviet, and Chinese sides in
the Vietnam War were mistaken. The North Vietnamese leaders viewed the
war as a national struggle for liberation. They were aiming for a
military victory, which they realized could only come about after a US
disengagement. The Soviets realized that the war in Vietnam was to the
US detriment in the global Cold War struggle, since it alienated Third
World countries and movements, and made the Soviet Union seem a country
that stood for peace and assistance to little Vietnam fighting the
American Goliath. By almost every measure, the stakes in Vietnam were
extremely low for the USSR and increasingly high for the United States.
But Moscow was always wary of the war spreading elsewhere in southeast
Asia, thereby forcing the Soviets to take a more active and visible role
in defense of local revolutions. As things were, Khrushchev's successors
were happy to condemn US aggression and provide limited aid to North
Vietnam (in part to attempt to pry it away from its alliance with
China), while privately telling Johnson that Moscow was trying to
moderate Hanoi's behavior. The not-too-subtle Soviet message to the
Americans was that Vietnam could be settled only if Washington was
willing to work with Moscow on other Cold War issues.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-322}It was the Chinese role in Vietnam that
changed the most, in line with Beijing's topsy-turvy policies during the
1960s. In the first part of the decade, and especially after 1962, Mao
Zedong increasingly used the war in Vietnam as a weapon against the
Soviets. The Chinese Communists, Mao proclaimed, gave full support to
Hanoi's attempts at fast-tracking its road to Communism and to
liberating the south. The Chairman's message was that where Moscow
prevaricated, Beijing acted. Chinese aid to North Vietnam increased
significantly year on year, as Hanoi ideologically sided with China in
its quarrels with the Soviets. But as the US engagement widened in 1964,
Mao was keen to avoid a direct conflict with the Americans, as had
happened in Korea. Beijing signaled to Washington that it would not get
involved with its own forces unless the Americans invaded the north. In
spite of his increasingly revolutionary stance domestically and
internationally, Mao had a healthy respect for American power. Besides,
with his confrontation with the Soviets worsening---mostly, it should be
said, by his own actions---Mao Zedong had little appetite for an all-out
war in Indochina. Therefore, China's policy came to consist of aiding
the North Vietnamese and the NLF in the south, while egging them on to
fight "relentlessly" against the Americans and eschew all negotiations.
But Beijing had also learned from Korea not to take any chances. By 1967
China had 170,000 of its own troops stationed in Vietnam to help the
North Vietnamese with their defense, while being prepared to fight in
case the Americans crossed the dividing line between North and South
Vietnam. "My fundamental idea," Chinese premier Zhou Enlai told the
North Vietnamese, "is that we should be patient. Patience means victory.
Patience can cause you more hardship, more sufferings. Yet, the sky will
not collapse, the earth will not slide, and the people cannot be totally
exterminated. So patience can be rewarded with victory thus causing
historic changes, encouraging the Asian, African, and Latin American
countries, and playing down the American
imperialists."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en301en">^8^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en301}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-323}The Johnson Administration also saw the
war in Vietnam in international terms. Through 1965 and '66, the
president was convinced that weakness in Vietnam would translate into
setbacks elsewhere in the Third World and possibly in Europe, too.
Johnson principally saw this in alliance terms: if the word of the
United States did not stand in southeast Asia, what would allies and
potential enemies elsewhere think? But he also sensed---much encouraged
by his advisers---that things might be about to turn to the benefit of
the United States in some important regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin
America. What was important, Johnson thought, was to hold the fort in
Vietnam while other new countries---helped and encouraged by US
assistance programs---turned away from radicalism and toward freedom and
economic growth. Recognizing that foreign assistance was not popular
among the general public or in Congress, the president issued a special
message that was vintage LBJ both in form and content. "To those nations
which do commit themselves to progress under freedom, help from us and
from others can provide the margin of difference between failure and
success," Johnson said. "This is the heart of the matter.... We will be
laying up a harvest of woe for us and our children if we shrink from the
task of grappling in the world community with poverty and ignorance.
These are the grim recruiting sergeants of Communism. They flourish
wherever we falter. If we default on our obligations, Communism will
expand its ambitions. That is the stern equation which dominates our
age, and from which there can be no escape in logic or in
honor."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en302en">^9^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en302}</p>
<p>The Administration was right in seeing the mid-1960s as a turning point
in the Third World, even if they were wrong about the long-term effects
of that turning for Vietnam and the rest of Indochina. In Algeria, long
the tribune of Third World revolution, the army turned on President Ben
Bella in June 1965 and ousted him in a coup. There was little
resistance. The majority of Algerians felt that Ben Bella had been rich
in rhetoric but poor in the execution of his plans. They wanted a more
practical and pragmatic approach to economic development, which
delivered tangible results for those had fought for so long for a state
of their own. It was not so much the contents of the Algerian National
Liberation Front's (FLN's) program that people objected to, as its poor
execution and the increasing self-centeredness of the new revolutionary
elite. Army head Houari Boumedienne, whose forces took over the Algerian
capital under cover of acting as extras in the filming of the Gillo
Pontecorvo film <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>, promised fewer speeches and
more action, which is also what Algerians got over the years that
followed. In its foreign policy and in much of its economic planning
Algeria drew closer to the Soviet Union and away from Third World
idealism.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-324}In Ghana similar events took place. Kwame
Nkrumah, for almost a decade the unchallenged leader of his country and
a key Third World spokesman, was overthrown in a military coup in 1966.
Nkrumah had lost much popular support because his economic policies were
slow in bringing results and he was becoming increasingly dictatorial.
In 1962 he sacked the chief justice. Two years later he banned all
opposition parties and made Ghana a one-party state and himself
president for life. The coup came when Nkrumah was on his way to China
and North Vietnam, and the military officers who took over claimed that
one of their purposes was to save Ghana from impending Communist
control. In his book <em>Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism</em>,
published six months before his overthrow, Nkrumah accused his domestic
opponents of being engulfed by "a flood of anti-liberation propaganda
[that] emanates from the capital cities of the West, directed against
China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Algeria, Ghana and all countries which hack
out their own independent path to freedom.... Wherever there is armed
struggle against the forces of reaction, the nationalists are referred
to as rebels, terrorists, or frequently 'communist
terrorists'!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en303en">^10^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en303}</p>
<p>The coups in Algeria and Ghana were windfalls for the Johnson
Administration. Though there is no evidence that the CIA was directly
involved in either event, the US government had encouraged and made
clear its support for such action by the military. While the outcome in
Ghana was a military dictatorship with close ties to the United States,
the Algerian result was more murky from a US perspective. Boumedienne
was no pushover in international affairs, and his affinity for
Soviet-style planning was well known to the Americans. Even so,
Washington much preferred him over the Thirdworldist Ben Bella. In its
review of the coup, the CIA commented that "in many areas of Algeria the
army has probably already provided sounder leadership and administration
than Ben Bella's government or the FLN
party."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en304en">^11^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en304} Thinking
like the Soviets had become less of a challenge to the Johnson
Administration outside of Europe than anti-imperialist revolutionaries
and assorted friends of the Chinese or the Cubans. In spite of the Cold
War continuing, Moscow had become a sort of "normal" enemy---European,
straight-laced, and rather predictable---whereas the Third World was
chaotic and given to excess. At the core of US fears lay the suspicion
that future opposition to American global predominance might look more
Chinese or Cuban than Soviet.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-325}If any set of events should have given
Washington pause in this kind of thinking, it was the defeats of the
Left in Indonesia and Congo in 1965. Both still signaled that the
future, at least in terms of a Communist challenge, might not lay with
Beijing and Havana. They also, in different ways, indicated the
beginning of the end of the Third World as a global political
opposition. To Washington, counterrevolutions in Indonesia and
Congo---and later in Bolivia---confirmed that US campaigns against Third
World projects could work, if there were strong local allies, who fought
against the radicals for their own reasons. It was the kind of lesson
that conceptually could not be applied to Vietnam because such allies
did not exist there and because an aggressive China was right next door.
But the logical conclusion from this discrepancy, that the United States
should withdraw its troops from Vietnam, was equally impossible to carry
out because of the fear of being perceived as weak, irresolute, and
defeatist in Cold War terms.</p>
<p>Ever since Lumumba's murder in 1960, Congo had seen sporadic fighting by
Left-wing or separatist groups against a weak central government
supported by the Americans, the Belgians, and European companies keen on
exploiting the country's vast mineral wealth. By 1964 a full-scale
rebellion had broken out in eastern Congo, headed by radicals who took
over Kisangani (then called Leopoldville) and declared a People's
Republic. As Congolese troops, aided by European and South African
mercenaries and US advisers, approached Kisangani, the rebels took
European hostages and threatened to execute them if the offensive
continued. Prime Minister Moïse Tshombe, who had been responsible for
the killing of Lumumba, appealed for Western intervention. In November
1964 President Johnson decided to have US planes airlift Belgian troops
into eastern Congo to evacuate the hostages. "We couldn't just let the
cannibals kill a lot of people," the president observed from his ranch
in Texas.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en305en">^12^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en305} While
more than a thousand hostages were rescued, another two hundred were
killed, alongside thousands of Congolese. Helped by a large CIA-led
foreign operation, the Congolese government gradually took control of
rebel territory and exacted its brutal revenge.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-326}The US involvement in Congo led to angry
reactions from the rest of Africa, not so much because of any love for
the Congolese rebels, who were generally seen as a disorganized and
mindless lot, but because of its association with the former Belgian
colonial masters. The remaining Simbas (lions), as the survivors of the
People's Republic called themselves, got help from the Egyptians and the
Algerians, but also from the Cubans, who sent Che Guevara with a task
force of more than one hundred to fight with them in April 1965. Che
spent seven fruitless months in the eastern Congolese jungles,
increasingly frustrated by the rebels' lack of coordination and their
leaders' propensity for high living in Cairo rather than dire fighting
in Congo. By the end of 1965 the rebellion had been defeated. The United
States has been "licking [the] Congo rebellion," Johnson's deputy
national security adviser, Robert Komer, told his bosses. "We and the
Belgians have been practically calling the signals for Tshombe and
providing him with everything he thought he needed---money, arms,
advisors."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en306en">^13^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en306}</p>
<p>A world away from Congo, Indonesia was even higher up the US list of
international trouble spots. The Indonesian nationalists, led by the
mercurial Sukarno, had achieved their independence from the Netherlands
in 1949 with the United States as a facilitator for liberation. Part of
the reason why Washington had decided to push the Dutch toward granting
full independence to their former colony was that Sukarno seemed a
staunch anti-Communist. In 1948 his forces had fought a brief civil war
against the powerful Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and won a decisive
victory. But as Sukarno began to take more of an interest in
anticolonial struggles globally and radicalized his economic policies at
home, Indonesia fell out of American good graces. In Washington, the
Bandung Conference, at which Sukarno as host played the lead role, was
seen as a challenge to American foreign policy, and Sukarno became
another bête noir of the Eisenhower Administration. As the Indonesian
president turned toward a higher degree of centralization and
cooperation with the resurrected Communist Party in 1957, US patience
was running low. With the British and Dutch in tow, the Eisenhower
Administration carried out a covert program to help anti-Sukarno Islamic
rebels in Sumatra. "We must prevent Indonesia going over to the
Communists," Dulles told his British counterparts. "If Java becomes
Communist-dominated, the best thing to do was to undermine their system
by building up the independence of the outer islands, beginning with
Sumatra."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en307en">^14^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en307}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-327}The CIA's campaign against Sukarno failed,
but, understandably, left the Indonesian leader with an awareness that
the Americans were out to get him. In the 1960s his policies became even
more intent on building a strong central state for all Indonesians,
which in his view should include all of Borneo, New Guinea, and even
peninsular Malaya. He sought to formalize the coalition that kept him in
power, declaring his government to be based on <em>Nasakom</em>: nationalism,
religion, and Communism. When Malaysia became independent in 1963,
Sukarno predictably denounced the new country as a neocolonialist
British puppet state and started a three-year-long low-grade war against
it, which Malay-speakers called <em>konfrontasi</em>, the confrontation. With
Indonesian forces confronting British and Australian forces in Borneo,
and the Communist Party gaining ground politically in Indonesia, the
United States was desperately searching for a policy. The Johnson
Administration vacillated. The president wanted to withdraw all aid to
the country, but the Pentagon and the CIA recommended continuing
contacts with the military, hoping that its officers would act against
Sukarno.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-328}But Washington was not the only power that
hedged in its relations with the Third World firebrand. The Soviets
resented being criticized by Sukarno for being old, white, and sluggish,
and by the PKI, whose criticism was similar to the Chinese, for being
revisionist. Still, the USSR was by far the largest supplier of weapons.
Like the Americans, Moscow kept its lines open to officers in the
Indonesian military but had little direct political influence. The
Chinese, on the other hand, seemed close both to Sukarno and the
Indonesian Communists. By the early 1960s, with the Sino-Soviet split
visible, the Indonesian president imagined that he could pull Beijing
over onto a Third World anti-imperialist and anti--Cold War platform. In
speeches and writings he extolled China's significance. But Mao Zedong
was not equally convinced about the relationship. As the Chairman moved
further to the Left in the mid-1960s, Sukarno and his regime seemed less
and less trustworthy, simply because it was a "bourgeois" and not a
truly socialist government.</p>
<p>As tension mounted in Indonesia, Sukarno seemed to thrive on the anxious
political situation. He dubbed 1965 "the year of living dangerously,"
and stepped up his commitment to political and economic change. His
recklessness proved his undoing. In the summer of 1965, senior officers
were unnerved by the president's proposal to create an armed people's
militia to parallel the conventional military. The Communists,
meanwhile, feared for Sukarno's health, based on information from his
Chinese doctors. They assumed that with him gone, the generals would
turn on them again. The PKI struck first, by sanctioning a coup attempt
by Communist junior officers on 30 September 1965, in which six generals
were murdered. But the remaining generals, led by Suharto, struck back
and took control of Jakarta, "protecting" Sukarno and outlawing the
Indonesian Communist Party.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-329}The coup in Jakarta was followed by some
of the worst killing of civilians during all of the Cold War. Right-wing
nationalists in the military and some Muslim religious leaders fanned
out and organized massacres of Communists who seem to have been mostly
unprepared for the ferocity of the attacks. Minorities suspected, often
without any reason, of having collaborated with the Communists were also
set upon. The Chinese community was especially badly hit. In all, at
least half a million people were killed, mostly by being beheaded or
having their throats slit. "Like lightning," one eyewitness said, the
executioner's "machete cut through the neck of his victim, the one-eyed,
powerless bicycle repairman. His head went into the sack. Then his hands
were untied, so that it looked as though he died without first being
bound. At first, his headless body disappeared beneath the surface of
the water, then eventually it floated up. The next person killed was a
woman; I don't know who she
was."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en308en">^15^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en308} In one
part of the country, the rivers were so thick with bodies that it
prevented the water from flowing. The US embassy contributed to the
killings by providing the military with lists of
Communists.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en309en">^16^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en309}</p>
<p>Internationally, all sides seemed relieved that Sukarno was gone. The
Americans had the most reason to be relieved. "We may at last have
Sukarno on the run," Robert Komer wrote to President Johnson. "It is
hard to overestimate the potential significance of the army's apparent
victory over Sukarno. Indonesia... was well on the way to becoming
another expansionist Communist state, which would have critically
menaced the rear of the whole Western position in mainland Southeast
Asia. Now... this trend has been sharply
reversed."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en310en">^17^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en310} The
Soviets licked their wounds but blamed Sukarno and the PKI for the
disaster. The Chinese, from their parochial Maoist perspective, were
also unperturbed. "I think it will be a good thing if Sukarno is
overthrown," Foreign Minister Chen Yi said. "Sukarno could mediate
between the right and the left. But the future of Indonesia depends on
the armed struggle of the PKI. This is the most important
thing."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en311en">^18^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en311} Chen
Yi's fantasies were soon dispelled. The most powerful Communist Party
outside of the Soviet bloc was crushed forever, and Indonesia entered
its thirty years of Right-wing dictatorial rule.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-330}<strong>T[HE OVERTHROW OF]{.small-caps}</strong> so
many Third World leaders in the mid-1960s meant a crisis for the
movement as a whole. Tellingly, the Afro-Asian conference planned for
Algiers in the autumn of 1965 never took place. The fiasco of the
cancelled meeting was, said one of the delegates, "the tombstone of the
Afro-Asian
world."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en312en">^19^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en312} More
countries in the Afro-Asian group, such as Egypt, Algeria, Syria, Iraq,
and India, began orienting themselves toward the Soviet Union, at least
as far as assistance and models for development were concerned. The
Cubans and the Yugoslavs, declared Communists although of very different
ilks, also increased their influence. Other Third World countries began
emphasizing their own economic interests more, usually connected to the
export of resources such as oil. For the Americans this was an undoubted
relief. But these victories had to be built on. "In expressing your
pleasure to Sec[retary of] State and others over the Indonesia and
Ghana coups," Robert Komer advised President Johnson, "you make clear
that we ought to exploit such successes as quickly and as skillfully as
possible."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en313en">^20^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en313}</p>
<p>The turning away from Third World ideals in Asia and Africa hardened US
approaches to Vietnam and Indochina. In hindsight it is easy to see that
the Johnson Administration drew the wrong lessons from the mid-1960s
turnaround. They thought that American resolve in Vietnam had
contributed significantly to defections from radicalism elsewhere,
though even the CIA found no evidence for that being the case. The lack
of imagination in US policy on Vietnam from the mid-1960s on is
striking. Faced with continued political instability in South Vietnam,
Secretary of State Dean Rusk concluded in April 1966 that "vis-a-vis the
threatened nations of Asia, we must ask ourselves whether failure in
Viet-Nam because of clearly visible political difficulties not under our
control would be any less serious than failure without this factor":</p>
<p>::: blockquote
The question comes down, as it always has, to whether there is any
tenable line of defense in Southeast Asia if Viet-Nam falls. Here we
must recognize that the anti-Communist regime in Indonesia has been a
tremendous "break" for us.... But for the next year or two any chance of
holding the rest of Southeast Asia hinges on the same factors assessed a
year ago, whether Thailand and Laos in the first instance and Malaysia,
Singapore, and Burma close behind, would---in the face of a US failure
for any reason in Viet-Nam---have any significant remaining will to
resist the Chinese Communist pressures that would probably then be
applied.... Thailand simply could not be held in these circumstances,
and that the rest of Southeast Asia would probably follow in due course.
In other words, the strategic stakes in Southeast Asia are fundamentally
unchanged by the political nature of the causes for failure in Viet-Nam.
The same is almost certainly true of the shockwaves that would arise
against other free nations---Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the
Philippines---in the wider area of East
Asia.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en314en">^21^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en314}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-331}The United States therefore fought on in
Vietnam, even if victory seemed elusive. On the advice of the Pentagon,
the Johnson Administration poured more manpower and resources into the
country, building airports, deepwater ports, bases, and hospitals, plus
civilian assistance to the South Vietnamese government, which seemed
more and more given to in-fighting and less and less capable of
defending itself. The US air campaign was widened, employing B-52
bombers against targets inside North Vietnam. The strategy---if it can
be called such---was to deploy US troops to fight at the perimeter of
the South Vietnamese defenses to inflict maximum damage on NLF and North
Vietnamese units. The South Vietnamese army would then be able to handle
the NLF fighters within the core parts of South Vietnam. As Communist
casualties increased, the theory went, a point would be reached when
Hanoi would have no choice but to come to the negotiating table on US
terms.</p>
<p>None of the elements of this strategy worked. US troops under General
William Westmoreland inflicted massive damage on the Communist forces.
Eight hundred thousand North Vietnamese and NLF soldiers died during the
war, against a total of fifty-eight thousand US troops. But the American
battlefield victories could not be translated into the holding of
territory. As soon as the Americans moved on, Communist units moved back
in. There were whole areas that were held by the South Vietnamese and
Americans by day, and by the NLF at night. The loyalty of the local
population to the Saigon government was dubious all over the country.
Although most peasants simply wanted to get away from the fighting, a
substantial number of young men and women volunteered to fight for the
Communists. To overcome their problems of control, the Americans and
South Vietnamese started moving peasants into "strategic hamlets,"
where---ostensibly---they would benefit from better housing and
education. In reality it was to keep the peasants from contact with the
NLF. But the results of such wartime social engineering were often the
opposite of what was desired, as South Vietnamese resented being moved
from their ancestral farms and villages.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-332}As in all Cold War conflicts, the civilian
population suffered greatly. About fifty thousand North Vietnamese died
in US bombing raids. The United States dropped more bombs on the north
than it did on Japan during all of World War II. More than two hundred
thousand died in Communist political campaigns, north and south.
Hundreds of thousands became refugees in their own country, and tens of
thousands were injured as a result of US napalm bombing or use of Agent
Orange. The Vietnam War was one of the most tragic manifestations of the
Cold War, fought, it now seems, with massive casualties and for no good
purpose.</p>
<p>One key reason why US strategy did not work was support for North
Vietnam from China and the Soviet Union. Le Duan negotiated his
alliances skillfully. Although Moscow and Beijing were at odds during
all of the American war in Vietnam, Hanoi continued to receive support
from both, even after China and the Soviet Union nearly went to war
against each other in 1969. Hanoi achieved this in part by making
support for North Vietnam the litmus test of internationalist dedication
to the cause and in part by playing the two Communist great powers
against each other in terms of assistance. Up to 1965 Chinese military
and civilian support for North Vietnam had been more significant than
what arrived from the Soviet Union. Beijing and Hanoi had also been much
closer politically, with Vietnamese Communist leaders supporting Chinese
accusations against the Soviets for "revisionism" and
"right-deviationism." But Mao's Cultural Revolution radicalism changed
the relationship. The North Vietnamese resented being constantly
reminded of how they should behave politically at home and how they
should avoid "insulting" China by mentioning both Soviet and Chinese
aid. Red Guards made up of Chinese advisers rallied in Hanoi and
Haiphong to exhort the Vietnamese to condemn revisionism and learn from
Chairman Mao. Meanwhile, the Maoists held back Soviet military supplies
arriving through China. In Beijing, the Chairman still insisted that he
be the ultimate judge of how the Vietnamese should fight their war.
Meeting with North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong and General Vo
Nguyen Giap in 1967, Mao told them that "fighting a war of attrition is
like having meals: [it is best] not to have too big a bite. In
fighting the US troops, you can have a bite the size of a platoon, a
company, or a battalion. With regard to troops of the puppet regime, you
can have a regiment-size bite. It means that fighting is similar to
having meals, you should have one bite after another. After all,
fighting is not too difficult an undertaking. The way of conducting it
is just similar to the way you
eat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en315en">^22^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en315}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-333}Not surprisingly, the political leaders in
Hanoi were left with the impression that China was willing to fight the
war to the last Vietnamese. They therefore turned increasingly to the
Soviet Union. And the Soviets were willing to reciprocate. They saw an
opportunity to humiliate the Americans and chasten the Chinese. Soviet
assistance to North Vietnam mounted dramatically in 1967, both on the
military and the civilian
side.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en316en">^23^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en316} But at the
same time Moscow advised Le Duan and his colleagues to negotiate if the
opportunity arose. The Soviet aim was to ensure that the US war in
Vietnam went badly, while holding out Moscow's role as a potential
facilitator of talks. The North Vietnamese, understandably, made the
decision to attempt to achieve substantial and sudden victories on the
battlefield in order to empower them both in relation to their sponsors
and vis-à-vis the South Vietnamese and the Americans. Such gains, Le
Duan thought, would be important if negotiations were to begin. But he
also hoped for the collapse of the South Vietnamese regime and outright
victory.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-334}The North Vietnamese and NLF Tet offensive
began in January 1968. Hanoi ordered a sweeping military assault and a
general uprising in the south. Even though it never came close to
meeting its maximum objectives, the offensive shook the South Vietnamese
power structure and called into further doubt the efficiency of the US
commitment to the regime in Saigon. Communist units attacked across the
country, including in downtown areas of the capital. There they got
inside the US embassy, took over the main radio station, and fought
around the presidential palace. These operations, and similar
"spectaculars" across South Vietnam, were de facto suicide missions,
where the Communist fighters mainly were killed within a few hours. The
reinforcements from larger units never arrived, and the general uprising
failed to materialize. But the fighting in Saigon and other cities was
shown on prime-time American television, where some news anchors were
now starting to question the effectiveness of the war. CBS's Walter
Cronkite, just returned from Vietnam, told his viewers that "we have
been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders,
both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver
linings they find in the darkest clouds.... For it seems now more
certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a
stalemate.... It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only
rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an
honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and
did the best they
could."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en317en">^24^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en317}</p>
<p>One thousand five hundred US soldiers died and seven thousand were
wounded in the Tet offensive. Although the Communists may have lost
twenty times as many, the impression that the war was unwinnable started
to spread in the United States and among its allies. Since 1967 there
had been large-scale demonstrations against the war all over the United
States, organized by student organizations or by independent activist
groups. Coming at the same time as the increased militancy of the
African-American movement, many Americans started feeling that the
country had lost its direction and that chaos was threatening. To most
protesters, the resistance against the war in Vietnam and racial
oppression at home was one and the same. "Shoot them for what? They
never called me nigger," the heavyweight boxing champion of the world,
Muhammad Ali, told those who were trying to draft
him.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en318en">^25^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en318} Even Martin
Luther King Jr., a moderate civil rights leader, declared in April 1967
that "a time comes when silence is betrayal":</p>

compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most
meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked, and rightly so,
"What about Vietnam?" They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive
doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it
wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again

:::</p>
<p>The war in Vietnam destroyed Lyndon Johnson's presidency and made him
decide not to seek reelection in 1968. It was, in many ways, a tragedy:
an Administration that had such high aspirations for a domestic
transformation of the United States, and had accomplished so much, was
destroyed by a foreign war that it fought out of ignorance and Cold War
conventions. But there may be more consistency in Lyndon Johnson's
approach to the world than he has usually been credited with. For him,
as for Kennedy, domestic reform and fighting the Cold War went hand in
hand. The United States could not fully succeed in one unless it
succeeded in the other. The real tragedy of Vietnam in America was how
it became the catalyst for failure on both scores. Johnson left his
country more disoriented in terms of what could be achieved at home and
feeling less secure in terms of how it could impact events abroad than
it had ever been during the twentieth century.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-336}The real tragedy of Vietnam is of course
Vietnam's tragedy. As with Korea, Vietnam was torn apart by the Cold
War, both through the Communist Party's brutality and failed development
plans, and through American occupation and bombing. The difference with
Korea was that the Vietnamese Communists had almost a monopoly on
nationalist activism, and that the South Vietnamese leaders never were
able to establish a credible government of their own. Could this have
been different if South Vietnam had had more time to establish itself?
There is no evidence for that. On the contrary, the United States spent
more money and effort on Vietnam than on any other intervention during
the Cold War. That it did not succeed was not because of a lack of
endeavor. It was probably because Vietnam was the wrong place to
intervene.</p>
<p>As the Vietnam War moved slowly toward real negotiations, it was clear
that the American intervention there had meant a dramatic drop in
support for the US role globally. It is an irony that just when much of
Africa and Asia began to turn away from the Third World project and the
Cubans failed to revolutionize Latin America, the United States got
stuck in one of the few conflicts it could not win. Perceptually, it
paid a high price for its folly. Many of America's European allies
called for an unconditional end to the US bombing of North Vietnam.
France's de Gaulle, with characteristic smugness after France's own
disasters in Indochina, referred to the war as a Vietnamese "national
resistance" against the United States, and US escalations as "illusions"
that provoked China and the Soviet Union and were "condemned by a large
number of the peoples of Europe, Africa, Latin America and is more and
more threatening to world
peace."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en320en">^27^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en320}</p>
<p>In terms of the global Cold War, the US involvement in Indochina
provided opportunities for the Soviet Union to reassert itself as the
universal alternative to American domination and capitalist
exploitation. From the Hungarian uprising to the Berlin Wall and the
Congo crises, the Soviet Union seemed to fall behind. Challenged by US
power, as well as by dissatisfaction in eastern Europe, the break with
China, and the creation of the Third World, the Soviets and their system
appeared to be out of tune with the way the world was turning. Vietnam
gave them a chance to gain strength. That this reassertion happened less
through their own gain than through the failures of others is of less
relevance to the story at this point. If one thinks in bipolar terms, as
many people did during the Cold War, it comes out as being more or less
the same thing. America's loss was perceived as the Soviets' gain.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-337}Even though the focus on Vietnam did not
substantially divert US attention from Europe, where NATO remained
strong in spite of challenges by de Gaulle and others, it arguably did
prevent the Johnson Administration from fully engaging with other
emerging crises. One such was the Palestinian refugee problem in the
Middle East, where tension was again rising. Johnson had increased US
support for Israel, which he saw as a Western-style island of stability
in a chaotic region. The Israelis received more civilian assistance, as
well as access to military hardware such as bombers and tanks. Johnson
also deliberately turned a blind eye to the Israeli nuclear weapon
program. In 1965 the president told one of his Jewish Cabinet members,
Abraham Ribicoff, how much he appreciated working with the Israelis. "I
had a long wire from [Israel prime minister Levi] Eshkol yesterday---a
real good one---on my birthday. I have really saved him, and gone to bat
with his equipment and stuff. I've done it quietly, and, I think, quite
effectively."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en321en">^28^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en321}
The Palestinians simply did not figure in the equation.</p>
<p>Another omission was developments in southern Africa, where the
Portuguese clung to their dilapidated empire and white supremacist
regimes were developing in South Africa and Rhodesia. Southern Africa
was the last great decolonization issue, and Johnson skirted it as best
he could. While there is no doubt about his distaste for the South
African apartheid regime---Johnson was, after all, the greatest civil
rights president in US history---he felt that he needed both the South
Africans and the Portuguese onboard in Cold War terms. Robert Komer put
Johnson's dilemma to him succinctly: the Azores base, which the United
States leased from Portugal, "makes it hard to be anti-Portuguese, while
the UK's economic stake in Rhodesia and South Africa makes us reluctant
to push them too hard.... To the extent that we can stay slightly ahead
on these issues instead of being reluctantly dragged towards the
inevitable, we can keep our African affairs in reasonably good
repair."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en322en">^29^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en322}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter012.xhtml#page-338}But events in southern Africa did not wait
for the slow pace of change that the United States was trying to set out
for matters of decolonization and racial equality. By 1968 liberation
movements had taken up arms against the Portuguese in Angola,
Mozambique, and Guinea Bissau. In South Africa the main anti-apartheid
movement, the ANC, had committed itself to an armed struggle against the
regime in Pretoria. Instead of showing solidarity with the oppressed,
the Johnson Administration worried about Soviet and Chinese influence on
the liberation movements. Like African-Americans, Africans should be
grateful for what the president was trying to do for them, Johnson
thought. As his presidency went down in flames over black and student
unrest at home, coupled with an unwinnable war in Vietnam, Johnson
lamented his fate. "I asked so little in return," he told his advisers.
"Just a little thanks. Just a little appreciation. That's all. But look
at what I got instead. Riots in 175 cities. Looting. Burning. Shooting.
It ruined
everything."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en323en">^30^</a>{#chapter012.xhtml#en323} And
as Johnson wondered why American cities burned, the Cold War looked set
to take new turns abroad.

<p>After the Cuban revolution, no other event positioned Latin America more
in terms of the Cold War than the 1973 coup in Chile. By overthrowing
their elected government in the name of anti-Communism, Chilean officers
brought the global conflict home to an extent that few of their
compatriots had thought possible. They also brought terror and the mass
violation of human rights to a country that had known few such crimes in
the twentieth century. Supporters of the elected government were
detained in sports arenas and assembly halls before being sent off to
prison camps without any legal process. Many were tortured. "The torture
took place daily," a female victim recounted. "We would be blindfolded,
strapped to beds and then it would begin. There were electric shocks
administered to all over our bodies, and then there would be a
rape."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en324en">^1^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en324} Even after
a century of peace, Chileans could commit terrible atrocities against
each other in the name of ideology.</p>
<p><strong>B[Y 1973]{.small-caps} S[OUTH]{.small-caps} A[MERICA]{.small-caps}</strong>
was no newcomer to the Cold War. Growing out of an already established
US hegemony on the continent, its roots go back to the late nineteenth
century, when the United States gradually replaced Britain as the key
power in the region. But the origins of the Cold War in Latin America
are not all about the effects of US supremacy. They are also about class
and ethnic conflict inside Latin American republics and about the growth
of nationalism, populism, and the Left. On the whole, perhaps, the roots
of the Latin American Cold War fed on high levels of inequality and
social oppression. The region's greatest challenge has been to overcome
extreme differences in levels of income and the political instability
that such long-term inequities create.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-340}What the Cold War added to this mix of
dominance and resistance was the single-minded US preoccupation with
Communism that became relentless from the late 1940s on. Successive US
Administrations saw Latin American radicalism and Soviet-style Communism
as natural allies of each other. This obsession became particularly
important after the Cuban revolution, but it was visible well before
then, for instance in the US intervention in Guatemala in 1954. It led
the United States to ally itself with military regimes all over the
continent. These regimes were the real tragedy of the Cold War in Latin
America. They crippled the continent, even in those few cases when the
time of their rule overlapped with economic advances. They disassociated
their populations from participation in politics and from identifying
with the state. They prevented the social progress that would have
produced a more inclusive middle class. These regimes were not good for
their countries nor for US relations with their countries. But the Cold
War clouded the judgment of both Latin American elites and the US
government, producing a symbiotic system of oppression that neither
party benefitted from in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>T[HE RISE OF]{.small-caps}</strong> US hegemony in Latin America was a much
slower process than most people imagine. As late as 1939 the main
European countries were more important than the United States for
overall Latin American trade, even though US investment had increased
strongly in the interwar period. In the early twentieth century, after
the US invasion of Cuba in 1898, US influence spread gradually from the
Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America to the countries in South
America. But it was World War II that signaled the big breakthrough for
US supremacy throughout the Americas. By then, not only was the US
economy predominant over that of all of its Latin American partners (the
Argentinian GDP per capita, which had been two-thirds that of the United
States in 1900, had been reduced to half by 1950), but the war again cut
the continent off from its trade with Europe, and Washington attempted
to solidify its political grip in order to keep any influence by the
German-led Axis Powers out of the American republics. The fully
developed US hegemony in the Americas therefore coincided in time with
the Cold War as an international system, and should be understood in
light of it.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-341}The special fear of postwar US
administrations was of Communism seducing Latin Americans away from
US-inspired models of development. According to views widely held in the
United States, Latinos, like children, had to be guided onto the right
path in terms of politics and economics, and North Americans had to do
the guiding. If the US sense of purpose failed, then the Soviets and
their allies could do what the Germans and Japanese had attempted to do
during World War II: tempt the easily excitable Latin American republics
in directions that would be disastrous for US economic and strategic
interest and for the Latinos themselves. Just like in Europe, the ease
with which US images of Nazi subversion melted into equally frightening
depictions of Communist subversion is striking in US policy-making as
well as in public assumptions. By 1948, both the State Department and
the CIA were on the lookout for Communist influence in Latin America,
but could so far, as they truthfully reported to President Harry Truman,
see few signs of it.</p>
<p>For US Cold War presidents, Latin America was in a special zone in which
US power had to reign supreme to protect basic US security and US global
aims. Much as Russians in the USSR thought of the Slavic part of eastern
Europe as a sphere with which they had special relations for ethnic and
cultural reasons, many US leaders envisaged special relations between
their own country and the countries to its south, not because of
culture, but because of politics. The Latin American states were
republics, just like their bigger brother to the north, and had
liberated themselves from the European powers and initially shown much
promise. But all of the promise of republicanism in Latin America had,
in Washington's view, been squandered by the Latinos through their
lethargy, caprice, and moral inadequacy. Good governance in Latin
America needed a solid portion of US paternalism if it were not to be
enticed away from its purpose.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-342}But the US calling to guide Latin
Americans toward their purpose was challenged by North American concepts
of race and empire. From the nineteenth century on, white people in the
United States had been wondering whether Latin Americans were capable of
copying the US model of modernity. Could the "race" to which they
belonged---a construct that Americans of north European origin placed
far below themselves on the ethnic hierarchy---prevent Latin Americans
from ever achieving order and prosperity, even if guided toward these
standards? And furthermore: Was the US relationship with Latin America
one in which normal boundaries for interstate behavior were valid? Could
"republics" that in the US view had none of the founding virtues of good
governance---personal autonomy, law, property rights---be regarded as
equals of <em>the</em> American republic? Did the United States of America have
natural borders, and---if so---where did these borders end? As late as
1864 US secretary of state William Seward had believed that "five years,
ten years, twenty years hence, Mexico will be opening herself as
cheerfully to American immigration as Montana and Idaho are
now."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en325en">^2^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en325} In the
twentieth century, even if Latin Americans hoped that the United States
was gradually being socialized into behaving more like a normal state in
international affairs, many North Americans still questioned the
validity of their neighbors' national aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>A[S IF IN]{.small-caps}</strong> conscious response to US belittlement, the
political agendas in Latin America have since the nineteenth century
been dominated by nationalism. Similar to most other places, Latin
American nationalisms have been intimately connected to the emergence of
mass politics and have been manipulated by elites in order to strengthen
their hold on power. The common themes of all of the different
nationalisms south of the Rio Grande have been resistance to foreign
pressure, especially that of the United States, and a belief in the
national authority of military power. Especially in Spanish-speaking
America, there has also been a strong sense of cultural unity, a
pan--Latin Americanism of great force, though colored by the specific
national agendas and the geographical location of its activists. In the
first half of the twentieth century, Latin American nationalisms became
increasingly populist, often with very separate Right and Left
components, as happened in Europe roughly at the same time. Just as US
economic influence increased sharply, some of the internal political
conflicts in Latin American countries were coming to a head.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-343}If one believes that a substantial part of
the Cold War in Latin America was domestic and ideological, then the
1920s and '30s were certainly the first Cold War
era.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en326en">^3^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en326} As workers
organized and landless peasants protested against privilege and
oppression, the Russian Revolution set an example for some. By 1929
small Communist parties had emerged in fifteen countries in the region.
In some cases, such as in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, or Guatemala, they had
an influence far greater than their
numbers.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en327en">^4^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en327}</p>
<p>Brazil became a focal point for class warfare in South America. There
the young officers who took control of the main city São Paulo in 1924
were supported by Communist intellectuals. After being driven out of the
city, the revolutionaries set out on a long march through the country,
eventually ending up in Bolivia in 1927. Luís Carlos Prestes, who led
the troops, later became the head of the Brazilian Communist Party and a
central figure of the Comintern. But even where they gained some local
support, the adherents of international Communism and the fronts they
attempted to establish were usually no match for their political
competitors, who often suppressed them cruelly. The main leaders of the
new popular politics in Latin America emerging out of this period were
not Communists but radical populists, who were as much inspired by the
European radical Right as by the European Left. Vargas in Brazil, Perón
in Argentina, Cárdenas in Mexico may, at times, have collaborated with
Communists and other parts of the Left, but their aim was to strengthen
the state and their own personal power.</p>
<p>But while Latin American populism increased in strength, so did US
economic power in the region. During the 1920s and '30s---often seen as
an isolationist era in US foreign affairs---American economic
involvement in the southern republics increased steeply, much helped by
new trade through the Panama Canal, which had opened in 1914. American
investment increased, too, more than to any other part of the world. So
did political ties, and not all of them were to the liking of the new
Latin American radical nationalists. In countries as far away as Chile
the North Americans tried to use their economic clout to fix prices on
raw materials or intervene in elections. In Central America and the
Caribbean the United States intervened militarily no fewer than thirteen
times in the first three decades of the century. Under political
pressure at home, at the Pan-American Conference in Havana in 1928
Mexico, Argentina, and other Latin American countries protested US
interventionism. Before the conference, the Argentinian newspaper <em>La
Prensa</em> wrote that US "imperialism has thrown down its mask and free
people will reject it.... Orders by one government are [now] presented
as valid for all." The United States was attempting to be the "global
dispenser of justice" and the "supreme master through economic
control... humiliating sovereignty with an arrogance unworthy of great
nations."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en328en">^5^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en328}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-344}After 1933, the Franklin D. Roosevelt
Administration attempted to reduce anger in the southern republics by
its "good neighbor policy." In terms of relations with Latin American
states quite a lot was achieved. Sensing that they had a more
cooperative, or at least a more gracious, Administration in place in the
White House, southern republics were more likely to go along with the
isolation of enemy states in World War II. Nine Latin American states
declared war on Japan and Germany right after the attack on Pearl
Harbor. By the time the war ended eleven other states had joined the
United States, though Argentina joined only in March 1945 and Chile the
following month, after the fighting in Europe had ended.</p>
<p>The main US security preoccupation during the war was with Mexico. With
a two-thousand-mile-long border with the United States, a large
immigrant population, and with a history of opposing US foreign policy
in the region, Mexico stood out as a country from where enemy agents
could operate. Mexico had declared war on the Axis Powers in May 1942,
but the US government remained suspicious of its southern neighbor's
political orientation. And if Mexico seemed suspicious, then Argentina
seemed positively alarming: having at first refused to join the Allies,
Argentina was embargoed and Washington broke off diplomatic relations in
1944. The political instability in Buenos Aires also alarmed the
Americans, especially after Juan Perón became vice president as the war
was coming to an end. Colonel Perón represented the exact US image of a
Latin American rabble-rouser. He had been involved in several military
coups, was building organizations with a personal loyalty to him, and
had been known to praise European Fascism and Nazism. When Perón was
elected Argentinian president in 1946, he allowed escapees from Nazi
Europe into Argentina, leading to another diplomatic crisis with
Washington.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-345}US policy toward Argentina under Perón set
a pattern for its policies toward Latin American countries during the
Cold War. As the US focus on subversion in the southern republics
changed from Fascists to Communists in the late 1940s, much of the
approach stayed the same. Latin Americans could not be trusted to come
up with political preferences of their own, even through elections.
Domestic and foreign subversives were waiting in the wings to take over
the political stage, using radical populists as the warm-up act. The
United States therefore had to be on its guard against any change that
would allow Communists to get closer to power in any American republic.
As the architect of the US containment policy, George F. Kennan,
observed in 1950: "implicit in these communist activities is the
possible wrecking of... the relationships... basic to Latin America's
part in our global policies.... The danger lies less in the
[Communist] conquest of mass support than in the clever infiltration
of key positions, governmental and otherwise, from which to sabotage
relations between these countries and the United
States."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en329en">^6^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en329}</p>
<p>The first test of the attention the United States paid to Latin America
in a Cold War context came in Guatemala in 1954, when the Eisenhower
Administration intervened against an elected radical reformist regime
that had the support of the miniscule Guatemalan Communist Party. Led by
Jacobo Árbenz, an officer from a wealthy family, the elected government
attempted to introduce much needed social and land reform in what was
probably the most unequal country in all of Latin America. In Guatemala
2.5 percent of the population owned more than 70 percent of the arable
land, and the majority of the population was landless peasants. Since
the late nineteenth century US companies, including the powerful United
Fruit Company, had grown rich from production in Guatemala because of
its good conditions for tropical fruit and its low wages. In 1952
President Árbenz expropriated uncultivated land---including some that
belonged to US companies---against compensation that the owners found to
be far too low. The Guatemalan government divided the expropriated land
among one hundred thousand landless peasant families. Washington
protested, but to no avail.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-346}It was not the complaints of United Fruit
executives, or the stories their PR department planted in North American
newspapers, however, that made the US government decide to intervene. It
was the fear of Communism. "In Guatemala," President Eisenhower told a
Congressional delegation, "the Reds are in control and they are trying
to spread their influence to San Salvador as a first step of the
breaking out... to other South American
countries."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en330en">^7^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en330} By
spring 1954 Eisenhower had given the green light to prepare the
overthrow of Árbenz, and the CIA put together an operation that also
involved military opponents of the Guatemalan president and parts of the
civilian opposition. The United States organized the training of rebel
troops, set up a propaganda radio station, and---after the Guatemalan
government tried to boost its military capacity through buying arms from
Czechoslovakia, a member of the Soviet bloc---declared a blockade
against the country.</p>
<p>In June 1954 US-trained rebel troops crossed into Guatemala, with lists
of Left-wingers marked for "elimination" by the CIA. US-piloted fighter
planes strafed the capital. After a few weeks of fighting Árbenz
resigned, mainly because he thought that was the only way to stave off a
full-scale US invasion. He was replaced with a succession of military
juntas that had the blessing of the United States. The military revoked
most of Árbenz's social reforms. From the 1960s to the 1990s Guatemala's
inequities set off civil wars that devastated the country. The US-led
overthrow of President Árbenz had created conflicts that neither the
United States nor the Guatemalan Right could control. From his exile in
Cuba, the former president concluded that it was US anti-Communism that
had set off the intervention, not the need to protect American
investments. "They would have overthrown us even if we had grown no
bananas," Árbenz's close friend José Manuel Fortuny is quoted as
saying.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en331en">^8^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en331}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-347}There is little doubt that Árbenz was
right about what set off the US intervention. Secretary of State Dulles
celebrated his overthrow as "the biggest success in the last five years
against
Communism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en332en">^9^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en332} But
US diplomacy paid a significant price for its belligerence toward
Guatemala. Even after the Czechoslovak weapons imports became known,
Washington had a tough time getting even its allies in line. Uruguayan
foreign minister Justino Jiménez de Aréchaga lauded "the intangible
greatness of the principle of nonintervention" and chided those who
indulged in "hysterical fear" or "use the phrase 'cold war' too
generously."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en333en">^10^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en333}
Árbenz's foreign minister Guillermo Toriello "said many things some of
the rest of us would like to say if we dared," one Latin American
diplomat told the <em>New York
Times</em>.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en334en">^11^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en334} Even
Winston Churchill's British government objected: "The Americans are
making extraordinarily heavy weather over all this and acting in a
manner which is likely to alienate world
sympathy."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en335en">^12^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en335}
President Eisenhower, exasperated, told his staff that they were "being
too damned nice to the British" and ordered the State Department to
"show the British that they have no right to stick their nose into
matters which concern this hemisphere entirely.... Let's give them a
lesson."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en336en">^13^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en336}</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had no role in the events in Guatemala; the distance
was too great and its Communists regarded as too weak for Moscow to take
much notice. It was the US intervention that set off a degree of Soviet
interest. But even after Guatemala the general feeling in Moscow was
that there was little that could be done to help Latin American
revolutionaries, except through some increased support for the local
Communist parties. Outside Europe, the Soviet focus was on Asia,
where---following in the footsteps of the Chinese revolution---some of
the great events of the future were expected to take place. Within this
larger picture, Latin American Communists were left to fend for
themselves. They helped organize, and sometimes had a significant impact
within, the labor movements in their countries. But nowhere did they
come close to holding political power or directing the general course of
events.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-348}The consolidation of the Cuban revolution
changed all of that. By 1959 there was in Latin America a radical
revolutionary government that operated in conjunction with local
Communists. And even if the Cuban Communist Party as such had played a
very limited role in the civil war---and was soon overshadowed by Fidel
Castro's own revolutionary organization, with which it was to merge in
1961---Communists played a key role in the new regime from the
beginning. The Soviets became Cuba's closest ally, in spite of policy
differences that waxed and waned throughout the 1960s. Supported by most
leading Latin American Communists, Moscow wanted a gradualist approach
to revolution in other countries in the region and was skeptical of the
insurrectionist guerrilla approach that the Cubans stood for. There was
also the sense among South American radicals that Cuba was peripheral
both geographically and historically to the main developments on the
continent---it is quite clear that many Left-wingers in Argentina,
Chile, or Brazil, at least to begin with, looked down their noses at the
new leaders in Havana. But these conflicts and doubts were of minor
importance compared to the big story: for the first time Latin America
had seen a successful socialist revolution, which---with the active help
of the Soviet Union---was able to defend itself against US attacks.</p>
<p>The Cuban revolution inspired radicals elsewhere, but not all of them
were in Communist parties. In Venezuela, where free elections in 1959
had brought to power a reformist coalition headed by President Rómulo
Betancourt, it was the youth wing of the president's own party that
broke away and formed the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR).
Accusing Betancourt of compromising with the United States, the
military, and the Right, the young Marxist-Leninists in MIR---with Cuban
support---launched an armed uprising against him. The Communist Party
joined the revolt, but it was soon defeated by the Venezuelan military.
The two parties turned to urban terrorism and guerrilla fighting in the
countryside. Among their tactics were robbing banks, killing policemen,
burning down government buildings, and kidnapping wealthy businessmen.
Although both parties had some popular support at the outset, their
tactics lost them the political game. Trade unions and peasant
organizations campaigned for harsher measures against the rebels.
Ninety-two percent of the voting population cast their ballots in the
1963 elections, which the insurrectionists tried to disrupt. By 1967 the
extreme Left in Venezuela had been defeated and the insurrectionism
often associated with the Cuban experience seemed a lost cause among
most Latin Americans.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-349}US worries about Cuba being replicated
elsewhere knew no bounds, however. The Kennedy Administration was
obsessed with the thought of Communist encroachment to its south. But it
was also much more aware than its predecessors had been that it was
poverty and social injustice that created the conditions under which
radical political movements could operate successfully. In April 1961,
just weeks before his Bay of Pigs attack on Cuba, the young US president
launched what he called an Alliance for Progress between his country and
Latin America. A ten-point program centering on development and economic
assistance, while also promising to defend any country whose
"independence is endangered," Kennedy's plan aimed to eradicate poverty
in Latin America within ten years.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
If we are successful, if our effort is bold enough and determined
enough, then the close of this decade will mark the beginning of a new
era in the American experience. The living standards of every American
family will be on the rise, basic education will be available to all,
hunger will be a forgotten experience, the need for massive outside help
will have passed, most nations will have entered a period of
self-sustaining growth, and, although there will be still much to do,
every American Republic will be the master of its own revolution and its
own hope and
progress.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en337en">^14^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en337}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-350}In spite of the president's lofty
rhetoric, the aims of the Alliance for Progress were far too extensive
to be realistic. Local elites feared what Kennedy's "revolution" would
do to their own privileges. Radicals on the Left and the Right saw the
Alliance as US imperialism by other means. The hierarchies of the
Catholic church worried about moral decline and religious deviation in
the wake of US Peace Corps volunteers and other North American experts.
And the methods and technologies the United States sought to introduce
were often unsuited for Latin American purposes. But in spite of all of
this, some Alliance programs did have an impact, not least because they
helped convince the emerging Latin American middle class that Cold
War--inspired US policies could be to their advantage. The best of such
programs---in education, health, transport, and housing---also showed a
more open, less exclusive United States that was willing to work with
its Latin American partners for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>The positive aspects of the Alliance for Progress were, however,
entirely overshadowed by US willingness to support antidemocratic
military regimes throughout the region. From the very beginning,
military aid to resist Communism was an integral part of the Alliance
plan. Under JFK's successor, Lyndon Johnson, the counterinsurgency
aspect of the Alliance often came to dominate the civilian programs.
Influenced by the widening war in Vietnam, LBJ was preoccupied with
avoiding any Communist advances in Latin America on his watch. The
president recognized the desperate social situation that drove young
South Americans toward rebellion. But if the choice was between another
"Castro revolution" and a right-wing dictator, then the United States
should be with the latter any day, LBJ believed.</p>
<p>If any country in South America seemed prone to upheavals for purely
social reasons it was Brazil. The country's inequality was the
second-highest in the world, narrowly behind Sierra
Leone.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en338en">^15^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en338} A small
white minority had income levels well beyond those in Europe or North
America. Meanwhile the vast majority---white and black---lived in abject
poverty, whether as landless laborers in the countryside or in the
rapidly growing urban slums, the favelas of São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro.
After years of dictatorship and military-influenced rule, Brazil began
to experiment with democracy in the 1950s. The president elected in
1956, Juscelino Kubitschek, started a number of state-led development
projects, which led to strong economic growth but also to sharp rises in
inflation. Kubitschek and his successor did little, however, to attack
the social inequality that seemed to be at the root of so many of
Brazil's problems. The Kennedy Administration, at the start of the
Alliance for Progress, often commented on the need for social reform in
Brazil.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-351}When João Goulart became president in
1961, the Kennedys got more than they had bargained for. From the
beginning of his presidency, President Goulart tried to get to grips
with Brazil's social problems by mobilizing worker's organizations and
supporting new and militant peasant groups that had grown up in rural
areas during Brazil's brief democratic era. His aim was to
counterbalance the many conservative forces in Brazilian politics,
including some within his own party. He also wanted more political power
for himself---Goulart was an impatient man, who had much to be impatient
about. In foreign policy the Brazilian president wanted more
independence from the United States, but was wary of both Cuba and the
Soviet Union. Goulart was from a very wealthy landowning family in the
south; he wanted reform but not revolution, and he kept the Communist
Party under strict political control. His program, however---which
included land reform and nationalization of utility companies---met
increasing resistance from the Right. In a massive anti-Goulart
demonstration in March 1964, organized by members of the Catholic
clergy, a proclamation was read out: "This nation which God gave us...
faces extreme danger.... Men of limitless ambition... have infiltrated
our nation... with servants of totalitarianism, foreign to us and all
consuming.... Mother of God preserve us from the fate and suffering of
the martyred women of Cuba, Poland, Hungary and other enslaved
Nations!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en339en">^16^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en339}</p>
<p>The Johnson Administration encouraged and supported a military coup
against Goulart that month, as demonstrations and counterdemonstrations
came to a head in cities all over Brazil. "I think we ought to take
every step that we can, be prepared to do everything that we need to do"
in order to support the coup-makers, President Johnson ordered. "We just
can't take this
one."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en340en">^17^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en340} The
fearmongering against Goulart that the United States had supported for
several months helped ensure the rapid success of the coup. The downturn
in the economy over the last eighteen months of his presidency also
helped the military leaders depose him. The military dictatorship that
inaugurated itself in 1964 was to last for twenty years, in which
Brazil's most basic problems were shunted aside and the internal Cold
War was stepped up.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-352}If the United States played a central role
in keeping the Brazilian dictatorship in power, it had an even more
important position in Bolivia. One of the poorest countries in Latin
America, Bolivia was ruled by General René Barrientos, who first came to
power in a coup in 1964 and was elected president two years later.
Barrientos was the Americans' kind of general, a young, energetic
modernizer with real support in the population, who wanted to stress
technology and land reform in an attempt to remake his country. US
advisers flocked to Bolivia. But politically the Bolivian president kept
his own counsel. Barrientos was a populist who presented himself as a
staunch Christian while fathering dozens of children in extramarital
relationships; a Quechua-speaking friend of the Indians who massacred
peasants and miners when they objected to his rule; and a US-trained air
force pilot and modernizer who easily engaged in anti-US rhetoric when
politically expedient. By 1967 he was at the peak of his power---flying
around the country in a helicopter he piloted himself, handing out
footballs and radios, and shaking people's hands.</p>
<p>This was the political situation in Bolivia when the Cubans decided to
make the country a test case for their doctrine of insurgency. The
operation was spearheaded by Che Guevara, who had become increasingly
restless in Cuba. Che thought of himself as an international
revolutionary, linked both to pan--Latin Americanism and Communist
internationalism. By 1966 Che and Cuban intelligence had begun to
prepare support for an armed rebellion in Bolivia. Che rather
abruptly---and against the advice of the Bolivian Communist
Party---decided to lead the insurgency himself. He was smuggled into the
Bolivian countryside in October 1966. From there a number of agents had
been preparing the situation for months. Che's guerrillas scored some
early victories against Bolivian military regulars and the insurgency
gained the support of some militant miners, thanks to the Bolivian
Communist Party's decision to throw its weight behind the Cuban
operation. But otherwise everything went wrong for the guerrillas from
the very beginning. Soon they were isolated in a couple of rural areas,
not able to recruit from among Bolivian peasants, and cut off from
contact with Havana.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-353}For Barrientos the contest with the Cubans
was a campaign he relished. Believing that he personified the Bolivian
"revolution," as he called his program, he was doing battle against
foreigners and invaders. He also liked the fact that as long as the
Communist insurgency was under way, he had extra claims on US military
and economic support. "The Fatherland is in danger," Barrientos
proclaimed. "A vast Communist conspiracy, planned and funded by
international extremism has exploited the good faith of some sectors of
labor in trying to pit the people against the armed
forces."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en341en">^18^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en341} In
October 1967---starving and almost out of ammunition---Che Guevara was
captured by Barrientos's special forces and summarily executed. He told
his interrogators, who included agents of the CIA, that his defeat was
due to "the effective organization of Barrientos's political party...
who took charge of warning the army about our
movements."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en342en">^19^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en342} Che
Guevara lived on as a revolutionary icon, though his political defeat in
Bolivia was another massive setback for those who believed in vanguard
insurgencies as the path to Latin American socialist revolutions. It was
also a signal that populist nationalism was a real match for Communism
all over the continent. René Barrientos did not live long to savor his
victory, though. His helicopter crashed in the mountains of central
Bolivia in 1969, killing all onboard.</p>
<p>Che Guevara's death symbolized the final collapse of the <em>foco</em> approach
to revolution---the belief that a small group of armed revolutionaries
by themselves could provide a focus, <em>foco</em>, for discontent and lead an
insurrection. But people drew different lessons from that collapse. In
Chile, for instance, Socialists and Communists stressed that only a
peaceful road to a socialist society would be possible. The United
States government believed that Che's defeat meant that its policy of
arming and supporting strong local leaders was working. It was
nationalist anti-Communists who would defeat the Left, not US
interventions. This conclusion fitted an intervention-weary Vietnam War
generation of US leaders well. It also went with what some Americans
thought were the general lessons of the mid-1960s, from Ghana to
Indonesia, where local armies had overthrown their Leftist governments
with US encouragement but little direct US support. Meanwhile, a
successful direct US intervention in the small Dominican Republic in
1965 had been justified by anti-Communist rhetoric, but could as well be
seen as one in a series of such invasions in the Caribbean going back to
well before the Cold War. It was not an operation that could be
replicated on the South American mainland, Washington believed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-354}Small groups on the radical Left drew
different lessons from Guevara's defeat. They formed new clandestine
organizations that aimed at destroying the existing order through armed
combat, but now often in the cities, not in the countryside. In
Guevara's homeland Argentina a number of youth movements challenged the
government and some of them began using urban guerrilla methods. They
came from a wide array of ideological backgrounds. Some were Trotskyist
or Marxist-Leninist. Others were inspired by nationalism or by radical
Catholicism. The largest movement, the Montoneros, were Peronists whose
leaders had often emerged from the nationalist Right, but who by the
late 1960s had begun taking up Left-wing revolutionary phrases in the
quest for the return of their hero from his exile in Spain. Their
leader, Mario Firmenich, liked the slogan <em>La patria socialista, sin
Yanquis ni Marxistas</em> (A socialist nation without Yankees or
Marxists).<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en343en">^20^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en343}
Between them, these groups and the military's increasingly violent
repression subjected Argentina to a time of terror.</p>
<p>At first the Montoneros gained some public support for their spectacular
kidnapping and execution of Argentina's former military dictator Pedro
Aramburu in 1970. He was widely hated as the man who had overthrown
Perón in 1955. But as the urban guerrillas began a series of murders,
kidnappings, bomb attacks, and bank robberies, their support evaporated.
Still, they were able to recruit enough supporters to carry out a steady
stream of terror, close to one attack per day in the early
1970s.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en344en">^21^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en344} Nobody
was safe. The Leftist guerrillas assassinated military officers,
industrialists, trade unionists, priests, and foreign diplomats, almost
seven hundred in total between 1969 and 1975. The terror did not abate
after Perón <em>did</em> return as president in 1973. By 1975 Argentina seemed
ungovernable, as did neighboring Uruguay, where the Tupamaros guerrilla
group carried out similar attacks.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-355}The first part of the Cold War conflict in
Latin America was to come to a head, though, in Chile, on the other side
of the Andes mountains. The country had a strong working class, parts of
which had been organized in trade unions since the early interwar years.
The political parties of the Left, Socialists and Communists, also
commanded a substantial following. In the 1964 elections the candidate
of their coalition, Salvador Allende, pulled more than 38 percent of the
vote. He lost against the candidate of the Christian Democrats, Eduardo
Frei, whose campaign was heavily backed by the CIA. But while the
Johnson Administration was very afraid of the consequences if the Left
won the election, the Christian Democrat Frei was no automatic supporter
of American interests. As president he began many important domestic
reforms that Allende could build on when he---in a sharply contested
election---won the presidency in 1970, in spite of the CIA's attempts to
stop him.</p>
<p>The new government was an alliance of Socialists and Communists
dedicated to overcoming capitalism in Chile. While drawing inspiration
from the Russian revolution, it intended to carry out a peaceful
transition to a socialist state, through "the principle of legality, the
development of institutions, political freedom, the prevention of
violence, and the socialization of the means of production," as Allende
noted in his first presidential address to
Congress.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en345en">^22^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en345} But
Chile was a very conservative society, in which the old bourgeoisie and
the new middle class had no intention of allowing a transition to
socialism, peaceful or not. The reforms of Allende's government were met
with growing protest, with the Chilean people split down the middle.
Working-class and peasants' organizations supported Allende policies of
nationalization and land reform, but all political groups outside the
Left, including the Christian Democrats, opposed them. The government,
the opposition claimed, "has sought to conquer absolute power with the
obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political
and economic control by the state and, in this manner, fulfilling the
goal of establishing a totalitarian
system."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en346en">^23^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en346}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-356}In Washington Allende's victory in the
1970 elections set off near panic. President Nixon thought Chile would
develop into a second Cuba, with enormous consequences for Latin America
and for the Cold War in the rest of the world. Détente with Moscow did
not diminish this perspective. On the contrary, both Nixon and Kissinger
believed that if Allende was able to succeed in Chile, then the Soviets
would be less likely to cooperate with the United States elsewhere. With
Allende's victory in a democratic election, the Soviets had a "Red
sandwich" between Havana and Santiago, which could engulf all of Latin
America, Nixon asserted later. Kissinger was, if anything, even more
alarmist. The manner in which Allende had won his mandate made him even
more dangerous than Castro, the US national security adviser claimed.
Chile presented an "insidious" model that other Communists on the
continent---or for that matter in western Europe---could follow later,
Kissinger said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en347en">^24^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en347}</p>
<p>By 1973 it was clear that Chile's future would be decided by whether its
armed forces would remain loyal to the constitution. The Chilean Right
and the United States pushed for a military coup. Washington had set off
considerable amounts of money through the CIA to create the conditions
for a military takeover and had been doing its best to sabotage the
Chilean economy, to "make the economy scream," as Nixon put it to CIA
director Richard
Helms.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en348en">^25^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en348} Both the
Soviets and the Cubans were dubious of the Allende government's chances
of survival, and the Cubans advised it to arm the population against the
threat of a coup. On its side, Brazil---the most powerful Right-wing
military regime in South America---was supplying intelligence to a small
group of dissident officers in Santiago, who were beginning to plan the
removal of Allende by force. The CIA knew that coup-plotting was going
on, but did not directly participate in it. The Agency only learned the
date of the planned takeover a day before the plotters struck.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-357}The Allende government was overthrown in a
military coup on 11 September 1973 (a reason why the significance of
9/11 in Latin America and the United States differs). The main reason
why the plotters succeeded was that they had won the support of General
Augusto Pinochet, who had just been appointed Allende's commander in
chief of the army. Pinochet betrayed his president with ease as soon as
he became convinced that the coup stood a chance of succeeding. The
general was convinced that Chile faced an existential battle against
foreign Communists and internal subversives and made certain that
maximum force was used against the government. President Allende killed
himself when soldiers stormed the presidential palace. In Washington,
the Nixon Administration drew a sigh of relief, and offered to assist
the new regime.</p>
<p>Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile lasted seventeen years. In a country
with a broad democratic tradition, its longevity and its brutality was a
shock to most people, including some of those who had supported the
coup. More than three thousand people were killed without any semblance
of law or process. More than forty thousand were arrested, most in the
three months following the coup, and many of them were tortured by the
military.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en349en">^26^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en349} "They
stuck us in a room and forced us to remain standing, with our hands on
our necks and without talking," one prisoner recounts. "Anyone who moved
or talked was thrown on the floor and beaten with rifle butts and
kicked.... [Among the prisoners] was a professor of literature at the
University of Chile. There was also a Catholic priest, and another, a
man named Juan, well known in the workers' districts of Valparaiso, who
later died during a torture session.... There were unbelievable howls of
pain, and they never stopped, day or
night."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en350en">^27^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en350}</p>
<p>By the late 1970s much of Latin America was ruled by military dictators.
In Uruguay the military had also taken over in 1973. In Argentina they
overthrew Juan Perón's widow, Isabel, in 1976, and established a
military dictatorship under the drab but murderous general Jorge Videla.
In all, fifteen out of twenty-one major states in Latin America were led
by military dictators by the end of the decade. Most of them used their
power to attack the Left. In Argentina almost ten thousand people were
murdered by the junta in their "dirty war" between 1976 and 1983. The
vast majority of them had nothing to do with the guerrillas who had
terrorized the country; most were labor organizers, journalists, student
leaders, or human rights activists. The same pattern was repeated by
military dictators from Uruguay to Guatemala. Their violence was much
more deadly than that of the Left-wing groups who had challenged the
existing order. And it could be carried out because the military
dictators knew that the United States would not break its ties with them
in spite of their human rights abuses. Even a group of people as
seriously lacking in talent as the Argentinian junta knew how to frame
their terror in Cold War terms. General Orlando Agosti, who commanded
the Argentinian air force, believed that he and his fellow officers had
won a war "within the national territory but the aggressor is only a
tentacle of a monster whose head and whose body are beyond the reach of
our swords.... The armed combat is finished but the global confrontation
continues."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en351en">^28^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en351}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-358}Brazil's military dictatorship, dating
from 1964, followed a different trajectory. Its terror against the Left
was widespread at first, with hundreds murdered and thousands imprisoned
and sometimes tortured. Small Leftist groups responded by terror
attacks, including the kidnapping of US, European, and Japanese
diplomats. But during the early 1970s, with the war on the Left already
won and détente reigning internationally, the Brazilian government began
a more independent foreign policy and a more state-centered plan for
economic development. Led by João Reis Velloso, the minister of
planning, the country implemented import-substitution and
national-development plans. Brazil was by far the biggest country in
Latin America. The Brazilian generals were nationalists who wanted to
strengthen the state and improve the country's international position.
They were inspired by other Third World governments, of very different
ideological persuasions, who saw state-planning, national control of
resources, and a more fair economic world order as central to their
countries' progress. To the great irritation of the United States,
Brazil not only supported Third World demands at the UN, but under
President Ernesto Geisel---a conservative anti-Communist of Prussian
origin---it recognized the Marxist government in Angola, which the
United States was trying to overthrow. Brazil wanted to be seen as a
world power, even outside the Portuguese-speaking world. The United
States responded by not renewing its military cooperation agreement with
the country in 1977.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-359}Outside of Cuba, the Soviet Union was more
of an active bystander than a main participant in the Cold War in Latin
America. It subvented the Communist parties and their fronts and
alliances (including Allende's Unidad Popular in Chile) with money and
with advice (sometimes welcome, sometimes not). It kept agents of the
KGB and the GRU in the field in even the smallest of Latin American
countries. Their task was more to report to Moscow than to influence
local events, however. "The main thing," KGB chairman Iurii Andropov
advised his Latin American operatives, "is to keep our finger on the
pulse of events, and obtain multi-faceted and objective information
about the situation there, and about the correlation of
forces."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en352en">^29^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en352} The
Soviets were ready to attempt to steer the course of events and to grab
opportunities whenever they arose. But in reality distance, priorities,
and the relative balance of power made Moscow a restricted influence in
Latin America during the Cold War.</p>
<p>But if the Soviet Union played a limited role in Latin America, so, in a
different sense, did the United States. North American power was of
course far superior to that of the Soviets, and in the Caribbean and
Central America US military intervention was always a possibility.
Elsewhere on the continent US economic influence was central, and
Washington repeatedly attempted to use the extending or withholding of
credit, investment, or trade as a political tool. It also on occasion
tried to manipulate the prices of raw materials on which Latin American
economies depended to gain political advantage. It trained Latin
American officers and supplied their armies with weapons. The CIA bribed
politicians and officials and spent money to subvent the political
campaigns of US favorites. But none of this enabled the United States to
set the agenda in any major Latin American country on its own. Latin
American nationalism---including that of the Right---precluded such a
total predominance. Unlike the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe---with
which it is often compared---the United States did not have subservient
ideological allies in power in Latin America. A Betancourt, a
Barrientos, or even otherwise despicable creatures such as a Videla or a
Pinochet, were not straw men for the United States. They were
nationalist Latin Americans, who opposed the Left for reasons that were
altogether their own.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-360}Mexico, with its long border with the
United States, is perhaps the best case in point. Ruled since 1929 by
the PRI, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, post--World War II
Mexico was a jumble of capitalism and corporatism, centered on political
compromises between the Right and the Left within the ruling party. But
at the same time, Mexican elites became increasingly concerned with the
threat of a challenge by the Left outside of the political system. In
spite of its corruption and authoritarianism, the PRI took pride in
having created a strong state, substantial economic progress, and
defenses against US political and financial pressure. Its failure to
create more social equality or more inclusive politics were its Achilles
heel. When movements of students and workers began protesting in the
late 1960s, the regime reacted with repression of dissent. The army was
used against protesters, killing hundreds. In one of the main housing
projects in Mexico City, Tlatelolco, scores were shot in a massacre on 2
October 1968. President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz's press secretary claimed
that the "disturbances" were caused by "international Communist
agitators... under the influence of foreign interests that the whole
world should
know."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en353en">^30^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en353} With US
assistance, the PRI organized anti-Communist militias, who acted against
"Cuban infiltration" of Mexico. At one demonstration in 1968, they
chanted "we want one, two, three dead Che's! Long live Christ the King!
Long live Díaz
Ordaz!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en354en">^31^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en354}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-361}<strong>T[HE]{.small-caps} C[OLD]{.small-caps}
W[AR]{.small-caps}</strong> in Latin America was internal more than external.
It centered on increasingly violent conflicts between the Right and the
Left, parts of which became ever-more politically extreme. But Right and
Left are complicated categories in Latin America. Within the Left were
vicious provocateurs of the Montoneros kind and principled reformists
such as Salvador Allende. The split between these two directions became
increasingly deep in the latter stages of the Cold War. But the Right
was deeply split as well. Some fought simply to keep their massive share
of money and resources. Others were deeply ideologically committed to
concepts of religion and nation. And some---especially in the small
middle class in the Southern Cone---saw the United States as a direct
inspiration in terms of politics and the organization of society.</p>
<p>As in so much else, the 1970s became a watershed for these political
tendencies in Latin America. The advent of the military dictatorships
did not mean "national unity," as they often proclaimed, but further
fragmentation. Within the Left, there was an increasing split between
those who believed in the democratic road and those who swore by
revolutionary violence. Sometimes these differences were dictated by
different histories or national backgrounds: it was a lot easier to
believe in a peaceful return to democracy, say, in Uruguay, with its
generations of parliamentary rule, than in Nicaragua, in spite of the
ugliness of Montevideo's military rulers.</p>
<p>But often the splits on the Left were a matter of politics or ideology;
those inspired by Cuba or by Che Guevara, or by liberation struggles in
Africa or Asia, frequently opted for armed resistance. Those who
organized in trade unions or within the church and those who belonged to
the old Communist parties mostly preferred peaceful activities. Mario
Firmenich, who had graduated top of his class at university in Buenos
Aires, admired Che Guevara (and Juan Perón), and became the leader of
the Montoneros guerrilla group. Luiz da Silva, known as Lula, who had no
education, became head of the Steelworkers' Union in the Brazilian
auto-manufacturing town of São Bernardo do Campo, and admired Gandhi and
Dom Helder Camara, the radical archbishop of Recife. Lula became the
first Left-wing president of Brazil. Firmenich became an economics
lecturer in
Spain.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en355en">^32^</a>{#chapter013.xhtml#en355}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-362}But if the Left was split, so was the
Right. The brutal military dictatorships that dominated Latin America in
the 1970s had little in common politically, except their disgust at the
Left and general references to "order" and "Christian civilization."
While all of them carried out bloody repressions, they had few ideas
about how to actually govern their countries---some even sought advice
from intellectuals who shared much of the general thinking that had
inspired the Left. So it was, for instance, that the Brazilian military
dictatorship came to emphasize centralized economic planning and a
somewhat Thirdworldist foreign policy in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>Chile under Pinochet took a very different direction. In a leap of faith
it linked its economic future to radical Right-wing US economists that
even many Americans regarded as extreme. Its policies led to the
impoverishment of much of the working class and helped the regime defeat
labor organizations. But at a time when much of the world slowly began
to move in the same neoliberal direction, the experiments carried out by
the "Chicago-boys" in Chile put the country's economy in an advantageous
position. To the regime's surprise, however, the new middle class it
helped create turned against it politically almost from the beginning.
By the mid-1980s it was not just the working class and the Left that
detested Pinochet; it was also many of those who had exploited the
privatization of the Chilean economy, who now regarded the dictator and
his violent methods as primitive embarrassments to their country.</p>
<p>The United States contributed significantly to the instability,
uncertainty, and violence that characterized Latin America during the
era of military dictatorships. It did so because of Cold War priorities.
Washington saw the defeat of the Latin American Left as a defeat for
Moscow, and it was willing to support the military dictatorships that
achieved this victory in spite of the violence with which their
campaigns were carried out. It was also willing to ignore its own
immediate economic interest in the process; the Brazilian junta
developed state-owned industries, practiced import-substitution, and
[]{#chapter013.xhtml#page-363}manipulated its currency to gain advantage
against the US dollar. All of it was accepted by Washington as long as
the Brazilian military was regarded as a bulwark against Communist
influence in Brazil. As so often in the Cold War, the logic of the
conflict defeated both self-interest and common human decency.

<h1 id="the-age-of-brezhnev-chapter-title"><a href="#toc.xhtml#toc-chapter014">The Age of Brezhnev</a> {.chapter-title}</h1>
<p>My students often balk when I call the late 1960s and '70s "the age of
Brezhnev." Surely, they argue, there must be more significant figures to
name an era after? What about Johnson, Nixon, or Kissinger? Or, maybe
even more appropriately, and certainly with more approbation, Willy
Brandt, Betty Friedan, or Julius Nyerere? They would be right in
substance but wrong in illustration, as students sometimes are. Nixon or
Brandt---in very different ways---may have contributed more. But it was
Brezhnev who symbolized the spirit of the age within the Cold War. In a
time when social and economic realities changed very rapidly, the Soviet
leader stood out for his unwillingness to conform to the new conditions
and his stubborn defense of his country's position within the Cold War
system. Cautious, reactive, formulaic, and technocratic, Brezhnev is the
very model of the middle Cold War, a time when leaders tried to impose
order on uncertainty.</p>
<p>Leonid Illich Brezhnev was born to Russian working-class parents in 1906
in a hardscrabble town in eastern Ukraine. He was old enough to remember
life before the revolution, but only vaguely; his whole life had been
spent in the Soviet Union. As the first in his family he went to
college, graduating as an engineer. He joined the Communist youth league
at seventeen and the Communist Party at twenty-three, in 1929. Brezhnev
passed through the Stalin purges unscathed---by sheer luck, he admitted
later---though several of his friends were arrested. During the war he
served as a political officer first in the Caucasus and then on the
Ukrainian front. By the time Germany capitulated, Brezhnev, not yet
forty years old, had been promoted major-general, after the Eighteenth
Army, which he served with, had fought all the way to western
Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-366}World War II was the decisive experience
for Leonid Brezhnev, as it was for all of his Soviet generation. It
taught him about the need for organization, discipline, and
ruthlessness. It also taught him about the horrors of war. There is no
doubt that Brezhnev, even though he rarely saw combat close up, carried
the images of devastation with him for the rest of his life, and they
made him fear war. "I do not want to inflict that on my people again,"
he told US president Gerald Ford in
1974.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en356en">^1^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en356} In war,
Brezhnev said, "everyone
loses."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en357en">^2^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en357} But,
while fearing the ravages armed combat could bring, he also believed in
the global mission of Communism and the need to defend Soviet
achievements, including the control of eastern Europe. "When forces that
are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist
country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country
concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries,"
he told the Poles in his usual clunky
terms.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en358en">^3^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en358}</p>
<p>Brezhnev became a member of the top Soviet leadership in 1956,
responsible for the defense industry. In 1960 Khrushchev, whose protégé
Brezhnev had been back in Ukraine, made him chairman of the Presidium of
the Supreme Soviet, meaning titular head of state. It was a safe choice,
Khrushchev thought, because of Brezhnev's low-key style and proven
loyalty. But as dissatisfaction with Khrushchev as party chief mounted,
more and more leaders saw Brezhnev as a possible successor. In October
1964 the majority of the Soviet leadership rebelled against Khrushchev
in what amounted to a palace coup. This time the first secretary had no
stomach for putting up a fight. "I thank you for the opportunity you
have given me to retire," he told his colleagues. "I ask you to write me
a suitable statement, and I'll sign
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en359en">^4^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en359} Brezhnev was
made the new general secretary of the Communist Party. Khrushchev
retired to his dacha outside of Moscow.</p>
<p>It was the first peaceful change of power ever in the Soviet Union, and
one with enormous implications for the future, not just because of how
it happened, but also because of the meaning that the co-conspirators
put into it. The main charges against Khrushchev had been that he was
uncollegial and rash, that he disparaged other leaders and acted on his
own. The mercurial, ever-present, high-handed Khrushchev was simply too
much for them. They wanted a more collectivist leadership, with the
party organization as the key institution. The accusations against
Khrushchev had referred to domestic mistakes, but in the materials
prepared there were also references to foreign affairs. In 1961
Khrushchev, it stated, had given "an ultimatum: either Berlin will be a
free city by such and such a date, or even war will not stop us. We do
not know what he was counting on, for we do not have such fools as think
it necessary to fight for a 'free city of Berlin.'" Khrushchev, it
continued, "wanted to frighten the Americans; however, they did not take
fright, and we had to retreat, to suffer a palpable blow to the
authority and prestige of the country, our policy, and our armed
forces."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en360en">^5^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en360}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-367}Brezhnev and his colleagues' mandate was
therefore quite clear. Those who had helped put them in power wanted
more emphasis on planning, productivity growth, and welfare. They wanted
a leadership that avoided unnecessary crises with the West, but also
stood up for Soviet gains and those of Communism globally. Brezhnev was
the ideal man for the purpose. As a leader, he liked to consult with
others, even if only to bring them onboard with decisions already taken.
After the menacing Stalin and the volatile Khrushchev, Brezhnev was
likeable and "comradely"; he remembered colleagues' birthdays and the
names of their wives and children. His favorite phrases were "normal
development" and "according to plan." And the new leader was easily
forgiven a certain vagueness in terms of overall reform plans as long as
he emphasized stability and year-on-year growth in the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>Contrary to what is often believed, the Soviet economy was not a
disaster zone during the long reign of Leonid Brezhnev and the
leadership cohort who came into power with him. The evidence points to
slow and limited but continuous growth, within the framework provided by
the planned economy system. The best estimates that we have is that the
Soviet economy as a whole grew on average 2.5 to 3 percent per year
during the 1960s and '70s. This is lower than both the United States and
western Europe during the same period, and considerably lower than the
east Asian economies, but enough to keep the economy afloat and provide
limited real growth in at least some sectors. In addition, the Soviet
planned economy provided an even (though slowing) expansion, unlike the
capitalist economies where unevenness year on year is part of the game.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-368}But the Soviet system also had some
intrinsic defects built into it. Inaccuracies in centralized resource
allocation led to high levels of waste in production. And the economy
was plagued by persistently low levels of productivity, which became
more visible as the economy grew and capital became more abundant
relative to labor. By the 1970s the diminishing returns of the planned
economy had become obvious, even though Soviet leaders hoped that
selective reform could reinvigorate it. In reality, though, the slowing
growth rate was hard to reverse. The very high growth in the early years
of the Soviet Union had probably stemmed from the exploitation of
abundant resources and simple catching up with a lag created by years of
war and dislocation. With the Soviet economy isolated from world markets
of technology, education, capital, and investment, further growth was
extremely hard to produce. This relative stagnation was an obvious
challenge, especially for a country that claimed to represent the future
of the world.</p>
<p>The direction of the output of the Soviet economy was almost entirely
decided by political priorities. Like their predecessors, the Brezhnev
leadership prioritized heavy industry and military hardware over
consumer needs, even if they claimed to have other priorities.
Therefore, though the economy as a whole expanded, consumer goods and
certain types of food could at times be hard to find in the stores. "A
woman walks into a food store," goes a favorite joke. "Do you have any
meat?" "No, we don't." "What about milk?" "We only deal with meat. The
store where they have no milk is across the street."</p>
<p>In the 1960s people hoped for better. The new Soviet premier, Aleksei
Kosygin, in 1965 attempted reforms that could rationalize allocations,
increase factory control over work methods and surplus, and reward those
who worked hard. But even Kosygin's careful reforms never got full
support from his colleagues. Soviet central planners were unwilling to
change their habits. Some felt that such innovation could threaten their
positions. Others were worried that rationalization and incentives would
get in the way of ideological purity. The result was a planning system
that did not stand the test of an increasingly complex economy. And when
some bosses fell back on Stalinist methods of coercion, that, too, did
not work. In Novocherkassk in 1962 workers had rebelled with the slogan
"Milk, Meat, and Higher Wages." They had occupied party and police
headquarters. At least thirty people had been shot as the KGB
reestablished order. Soviet authorities did not want to see
Novocherkassk repeated elsewhere in the country, and therefore were wary
of demanding too much from the working class they professed to
represent.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-369}While the structural problems of the
Soviet economy were clearly visible at the end of the 1960s, the overall
living conditions for its citizens and its military strength both seemed
to be improving. Compared to how they had lived a decade earlier, and
not least compared with the war and with Stalin's terror, the common
Soviet citizen lived a life of security and plenty under Brezhnev, in
spite of the shortages. More expensive consumer goods---cars, fridges,
television sets---while still in short supply, were sometimes available.
Most people earned what they considered an acceptable salary and lived
in decent apartments (again compared with the past). The state supplied
free education, health care, housing, and even vacations. Most families
had access to free day care and after-school programs. There was full
employment, free and generous disability insurance, and early retirement
age on full state pensions (55 for women and 60 for men). "It felt very
stable and secure," said a friend of mine who grew up in Kiev in the
1960s. "We had most of what we needed. Nobody starved. And we always
expected next year to be better than this year."</p>
<p>By the 1970s socialism had become the new normal in the Soviet Union and
there were few outward signs of opposition. Like in Europe and North
America, youth chafed under the conformity imposed on them by the
government. But the astonishing lack of democracy or due process of law
in a country that set itself up as the envy of the world did not seem to
trouble too many Soviets. Although propaganda was everywhere, the
Brezhnev regime was selective in its use of repression. Jews were
sometimes singled out for persecution, in part because of engrained
anti-Semitism and in part because of (mainly fictitious) links with
Israel, which by now had become an enemy of the USSR. Political
dissidents were imprisoned or otherwise punished, as were suspected
nationalists or religious activists in the non-Russian republics. But
overall the Soviet Union of the Brezhnev era seemed a country of
remarkable, though somewhat deadening, calm, especially compared with
the Russian past.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-370}Eastern Europe under Soviet rule also
seemed to have entered a new normality, even though it was not one that
most of its people wanted. Soviet and Communist control were still seen
as impositions by the majority. But people everywhere had learned to
compromise with the regimes and make the best out of their situation. In
this they were helped by modest but significant economic growth. Living
standards were rising everywhere. Even if the eastern European economies
suffered the same shortages of consumer goods as the Soviets did, they
still, overall, had a higher standard of living than further east. This
was especially true for the most advanced Soviet bloc countries, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia, where average monthly salaries for
technicians and skilled workers were substantially higher than in the
USSR. Even in Poland engineers earned on average 15 percent more than
their Soviet counterparts in
1964.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en361en">^6^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en361} Still,
people hoped for better, both in national and economic terms.
Underground leaflets and proscribed books proliferated, in spite of the
regimes' attempts to stop them and punish the distributors. Many eastern
Europeans still resented their lot, but they did so within a world that
had become more predictable and comfortable than before.</p>
<p>Even so, social and economic progress in eastern Europe paled in
comparison with what was happening in the West. Since the 1940s western
Europe and other countries in the capitalist zone (including Greece and
Turkey) had gone through a profound transformation. From being for the
most part agricultural, localized, and oriented toward their own
traditions and cultures, all of them by the 1960s were increasingly
urban, industrial, mobile, and literate. This had happened on the back
of strong economic growth, with the West German economy expanding 5.5
percent per year on average in the 1960s, the French 7 percent, and the
Italian an astonishing 8 percent. For many countries the 1960s was the
most intense growth period of all, part of what in France was called
<em>Les Trente Glorieuses</em>, the glorious thirty postwar years of economic
boom.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-371}In the core countries of the western
European economy, economic growth led to full employment and better
conditions for workers, at least in terms of buying power. The regions
at the periphery also benefitted, but on different terms: their benefit
was as much in the export of labor as in local industrialization.
Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, southern Italy, and all of Iberia sent
workers to help build the western European miracle. Around 1970, money
sent back by workers abroad constituted more than 50 percent of export
earnings in Greece, Yugoslavia, and Portugal, and more than 90 percent
in Turkey. It was Cold War alliances that made such migrations possible;
Soviet-controlled eastern Europe saw nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>With full employment came a significant role for the trade unions, but
in most cases (Britain being a partial exception) it was a less militant
role than that of the interwar period. Negotiating from positions of
strength, and with overall living standards for their members on the
rise, most unions were happy to be integrated into mechanisms of
collective bargaining within the capitalist system, rather than
challenge that system from the outside. In this transformation they were
much helped by the social welfare states that European political elites
were building. Much of the impetus for the makeover in the role of the
state came from the experience of wars and depression. But it also
signaled that significant parts of the European Left and Right were
willing to stand by their postwar dedication to new forms of social
security networks as the economies began to grow. Indeed, it was the
economic resurgence of western Europe that made the building of advanced
welfare states possible. By 1970 all western European countries had
developed systems of social security for the sick and elderly; they had
free education up to college level, a guaranteed retirement age with
benefits, and free or strongly subsidized health care.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-372}The western European welfare state of the
1960s was only possible because of the combination of demographic
growth, US consent, and fears over the ghosts of the past. Also, it
demanded strong political leadership and an exchange of technology,
products, and ideas across borders. Throughout western Europe, Social
Democrats and Christian Democrats supplied the leadership necessary for
creating a high degree of consensus around basic welfare provisions,
while also preparing to fight the Cold War. And US leaders, as fearful
of Europe's past as western European leaders themselves, put no
obstacles in place for the expansion of the European state or for the
expansion of European integration that seemed to go with it, even though
such measures in the past had been foreign to American thinking. On the
contrary, by the mid-1960s many of President Johnson's own US welfare
programs seemed modeled on European prototypes.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the only political challenge to the new form of capitalism
that was being created in western Europe came from the French and
Italian Communist parties. The other possible opposition, the Spanish
and Portuguese Right-wing dictatorships, had long since capitulated to
consumerism and welfare arrangements---it is very hard to be a Fascist
if you have a complicated and negotiated social security system to look
after. The French Communists were easily outmaneuvered by Charles de
Gaulle, who assumed both the nationalist and the collectivist mantle.
Only in Italy did the Communists present an electoral challenge. In 1972
they got 27 percent of the vote. And their key leader from the late
1960s, the young Sardinian aristocrat Enrico Berlinguer, was easily the
most popular politician in the country.</p>
<p>But, while its working class popularity remained, the Italian Communist
Party (PCI) was being refashioned from within. A new group of leaders,
symbolized by Berlinguer, believed that Italy had to find its own way to
socialism, and---increasingly---that the Soviet Union was a hindrance
rather than a help in that process. The 1966 party program emphasized
electoral politics, gradual reform, and the alliance of Communists,
socialists, and "progressive" Catholics. While continuing to communicate
closely with Moscow, and receiving much financial support from the
Soviet Union, it was clear that the PCI wanted to set its own
priorities, including in foreign policy, where Berlinguer began to
downplay the party's opposition to Italy's NATO membership.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-373}The Italian Communist position had much
influence on political views among Communists elsewhere in Europe, west
and east. The Spanish Communists in exile began thinking about a
peaceful transition from the Franco dictatorship to pluralist democracy.
The French party, still influential in the international Communist
movement, defended the Italian position when it was attacked by Moscow,
even though many French Communist leaders felt that Berlinguer was going
too far in his criticism of Communist traditions. Still, it was clear by
the late 1960s that at least some western European Communist parties
thought they now had more in common with each other than any of them had
with the Soviet Union, giving rise to the sobriquet "Eurocommunism" (a
term the Italian, French, and Spanish Communists never gave a concrete
definition, but which they were fond of brandishing when it suited their
domestic purposes).</p>
<p>Some eastern European Communists were also starting to query what the
future would hold for their parties. In Czechoslovakia, which had a
strong domestic Communist tradition that went back much further than the
1948 coup, younger party leaders wanted to develop a Communist state
that was more in line with popular priorities than had been the case
before. To begin with, they had the support of the Brezhnev leadership
in Moscow, which regarded the Czechoslovak Communist leader, Antonín
Novotný, as somewhat old hat. The new party head whom the reformists put
in place in January 1968 with Brezhnev's blessing, the Slovak Communist
Alexander Dubček, at first tried to manage expectations, concentrating
on economic reform along the lines of what had been proposed by Kosygin
in the Soviet Union. But very soon he came under pressure to allow a
more open political system and more freedom of expression. And, to
everyone's surprise, including Dubček's own, the party majority seemed
to agree with these demands.</p>
<p>In April 1968 Dubček launched what he called the party's "action
program." Confirming the "leading role" of the Communist Party in state
and society, the Czechoslovak Communists said that their country had to
find its own way to advanced socialism:</p>

fate.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en362en">^7^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en362}
:::</p>
<p>Dubček and his colleagues aimed for a gradual reform of the economy and
the political system, and hoped that their removal of press censorship,
which took place in the spring, would help to give them the time they
needed. They also believed that the majority of people supported
socialism, even though they wanted to see it reformed. But the
groundswell of criticism of the political system that quickly emerged in
the press surprised them. The Soviets were horrified, especially when
some Czech and Slovak commentators argued for their country's withdrawal
from the Warsaw Pact. Reluctantly, Moscow began contingency preparations
for military action against the new Prague leadership.</p>
<p>Dubček, who had started referring to his program of reform as "socialism
with a human face," was certain that he could keep the situation under
control. But the Soviets, who must have been wondering if they then
represented "socialism with an inhuman face," were not so sure. Together
with the leaders of the other Warsaw Pact countries, who were terrified
that the "Prague Spring" would spread to their territories, they worked
out plans for removing Dubček by force. At a hastily called meeting on
the Soviet-Czechoslovak border in late July, Brezhnev demanded that
"anti-Soviet statements" in Prague and Bratislava had to be stopped.
Dubček and his delegation promised that they would stop. The
Czechoslovaks tried to convince the Soviets that "events in our country
are not moving in a direction that would result in the destruction of
the gains of the revolution, much less does one observe even the
slightest departure from the socialist camp or from the foundations of
socialism." Kosygin acidly commented that the Czechoslovaks seemed more
preoccupied with attracting Western tourists than defending the Warsaw
Pact's common
border.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en363en">^8^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en363} After
returning to Moscow, the Soviet leadership at first decided to take no
further action. Even with all the preparations in place, Brezhnev still
hoped that a full-scale invasion would be unnecessary. Such an action,
he argued, might be required but would entail high political costs.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-375}By the middle of August the Soviet leaders
felt trapped. They wanted to stop a congress of the Czechoslovak
Communist Party, scheduled for September, from going ahead, because they
feared that it would enact further liberal reforms. Brezhnev called
Dubček on the phone one last time. He insisted that the Czechoslovak
leader immediately ban the most outspoken newspapers and throw
dissidents out of the party. Dubček asked for more time. Brezhnev
interrupted him.</p>

<strong>B[REZHNEV:]{.small-caps}</strong> Sasha, I can't agree with this. Over the
past two to three days, the newspapers I mentioned have been doggedly
continuing to occupy themselves with the publication of defamatory
ravings about the Soviet Union and the other fraternal countries. My
comrades on the Politburo insist that we make an urgent approach to you

<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-376}Brezhnev and Dubček agreed to speak again.
Instead, in the morning of 21 August, troops from the Soviet Union,
Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria invaded Czechoslovakia and occupied the
main cities. Dubček, President Ludvik Svoboda, and other members of the
government were arrested and brought to Moscow, where they were forced
to sign a protocol agreeing to the stationing of Soviet troops, the
closing of newspapers, and the end of the most controversial reforms.
There was sporadic resistance in the cities, in which seventy
Czechoslovaks were killed. Seventy thousand fled across the border to
western Europe. After he had been kept in place as a figurehead long
enough for the Soviets to hope that he had been compromised among the
Czechoslovaks who hated the invasion, Dubček was packed off to work for
the Slovak forestry service. His successor, Gustáv Husák, handpicked by
the Soviets, made Czechoslovakia the most repressive regime in the
Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>The international reaction to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
showed that the world was moving in new directions in the late 1960s.
Different from the aftermath of Hungary in 1956, the United States'
reaction was muted, almost nonchalant. When USSR ambassador Dobrynin
visited President Johnson at the White House to inform him about the
invasion, LBJ---consumed by the Vietnam War---barely took note and
offered the astonished ambassador a mint julep. The main reaction was
from ordinary western Europeans, who turned out in large numbers to
protest the invasion. Even the majority of western European Communist
parties condemned the Soviet action, with the PCI publicly calling it
"unjustified" and noting its "strong
dissent."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en365en">^10^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en365} To
Brezhnev's horror, Romania, a member of the Warsaw Pact, also dissented,
with its strongman, Nicolae Ceauşescu, calling the invasion a "grave
error and a serious danger to peace in Europe and the destiny of world
socialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en366en">^11^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en366}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-377}While the Soviets struggled to keep their
bloc together, US influence in western Europe remained high, though
American patience was at times sorely tested there. The United States
was seen as a guarantor for European security against the Soviet Union,
and support for the US military presence in Europe was strong. But
western Europeans, and especially young people, also sought inspiration
from the United States in terms of social trends, fashion, music, dance,
and film. Obviously US propaganda agencies, like the United States
Information Agency (USIA), tried to strengthen such biases further. But
the reality was that they did not have to, and sometimes, when they
tried, their ham-fisted ways did them more harm than good. Much more
important than the USIA were US commercial television programs, which by
the mid-1960s had become available to most Europeans. In the 1950s,
Elvis Presley and Marlon Brando had became US cult figures in Europe,
not least because of their rebelliousness. And when rock music conquered
the world in the 1960s, most of its reference points were American, even
for artists who were profoundly anti-establishment. A Bob Dylan or Jimi
Hendrix was against most things that the US government was for, but for
young Europeans of the 1960s, they opened a window to an America that
outsiders wanted to be part of, culturally if not politically.</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson's war in Vietnam dented this image but did not destroy
it. Older western Europeans, at least at first, sympathized with the US
effort in Indochina, because they likened it to what the Americans had
done in Europe after World War II. But younger people increasingly
disagreed, especially college students, who began staging protests, in
part inspired by their US peers. What was fundamentally wrong with the
US war in Vietnam, many people thought, was that a rich country was
beating up a poor country. But some students felt that American behavior
in Indochina was part of US imperialism, which Europe had also in their
opinion been at the receiving end of. The protests against the Vietnam
war in Europe were therefore, at least in part, a protest against what
some people felt to be an overwhelming US influence in their own
countries, a form of tutelage that could only be resented.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-378}But the protests that were spreading among
young people in the West in the 1960s were not only connected to what
was seen as an unjust war in Vietnam. They also came out of a sense of
powerlessness and lack of real democracy in their own societies. Because
of the postwar baby boom there were far more young people around and a
far higher percentage of them went to college, an influx that European
and American universities were not prepared to handle. Very often
protests that initially took aim at archaic forms of learning and
governance in universities were widened to become protests against
society's and the state's oppression of young people. And gradually at
least some of the youthful protesters began to see links between
unfulfilled dreams of equality and representation for themselves and
other marginalized groups: ethnic minorities (especially
African-Americans in the United States) and women, above all. The
capitalist world may be delivering economic growth, their argument went,
but not real democracy or equality. The Port Huron Statement, put out by
the US organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), in 1962
summed their accusations up well:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
Some would have us believe that Americans feel contentment amidst
prosperity---but might it not better be called a glaze above deeply felt
anxieties about their role in the new world?... The search for truly
democratic alternatives to the present, and a commitment to social
experimentation with them, is a worthy and fulfilling human enterprise,
one which moves us.... On such a basis do we offer... an effort in
understanding and changing the conditions of humanity in the late
twentieth century, an effort rooted in the ancient, still unfulfilled
conception of man attaining determining influence over his circumstances
of life.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en367en">^12^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en367}
:::</p>
<p>Although all western European countries saw youth protests during the
1960s, Paris in 1968 quickly became the symbol of what students and
young people could (and could not) do. There students began protesting
in the spring against conditions in the universities, and gradually also
against consumerism, patriarchy, and a general lack of democracy. Police
brutality against the protesters drew even more people to the streets.
"To be free in 1968 means to participate!" was one of the slogans. "The
boss needs you, you don't need him!" "Power to the imagination!" And,
the inimitable "Be realistic, demand the impossible!" By late May,
millions of workers had also gone on strike, against the advice of their
unions, demanding more influence in the workplace and better pay.
President de Gaulle panicked and left to join the French forces
stationed in Germany, whom he hoped would be loyal to him. Power seemed
to be in the streets; to some it seemed a classical French revolution.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-379}But it was not. When new elections were
held in June, de Gaulle won a decisive victory. The French Communists,
who had tried to join the youth movement even though they had been
politically attacked by it, lost half their seats. For most Frenchmen,
who had been through profound social and economic change since 1945, the
protests had provided an opportunity to speak out against conditions
that they found oppressive, boring, or simply puzzling. But at the
polling booth they confirmed their belief in the existing order, just
like many young street fighters did indirectly when they donned their
Levi's jeans or threw their Coca-Cola bottles at the police.</p>
<p>The real loser of May 1968 may have been the Communist Party. To young
people it seemed old-fashioned, timid, and increasingly out of touch.
Instead, some of the May protesters in Paris, alongside with their
sympathizers elsewhere, championed a New Left, in which Marxism was seen
as an instrument for personal as much as social liberation. The heroes
of their imagination were Leon Trotsky and Che Guevara (both safely dead
by 1968) or, remarkably enough, Mao Zedong, whose Cultural Revolution
they equated with their own rebellion against authorities at home. Third
World symbols and ideas received an afterlife among mostly bourgeois
youth in western Europe, where they were seen as representing part of a
global rebellion, in which some young Europeans also craved a role.
While the shrinking working class mainly remained sympathetic with the
old-style Communist parties in France and Italy, or the Social Democrats
in West Germany or Scandinavia, youthful rebels formed small Maoist or
Trotskyist parties of their own. As long as the Cold War lasted, none of
these new radical parties---the Trotskyist Lutte Ouvrière in France, for
instance, or the Maoist Communist Party of the Netherlands
(Marxist-Leninist) and the Norwegian Workers' Communist Party
(Marxist-Leninist)---ever got much support outside of university
campuses.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-380}The one social and political campaign of
the 1960s that had a lasting impact, also on the Cold War, was the
women's movement. While economic growth had exploded in the West in the
postwar era, the position of women within this growth was still weak: in
society, in the workplace, and in the family. One of the recurrent
arguments of the Communists was that the Soviet bloc had abolished
discrimination against women (an argument that barely held up but was
useful for propaganda purposes). By the 1960s, autonomous women's groups
in western Europe and North America had begun campaigning for a greater
role for women in all walks of life. Though discrimination against women
at work persisted, especially in terms of equal pay, these women's
movements scored some stunning successes in terms of legal rights,
family planning, and sexual liberation. The American feminist Betty
Friedan was among the many women who gave direction to these groups.
Could it be acceptable, Friedan asked in 1963, that women in industrial
societies could not combine being a homemaker with a satisfying and
well-paid job to which they were qualified through their education? "As
she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material,
ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts
and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night---she was afraid to ask
even of herself the silent question: 'Is this
all?'"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en368en">^13^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en368}</p>
<p>By the 1970s thousands of women leaders all over the West had made sure
that it was not all. The representation of women in skilled labor and in
the professions exploded. In 1980 there were 32 percent women lawyers in
West Germany (as against less than 7 percent in 1960). The changes in
politics were equally dramatic. In Finland there were more than 30
percent female members of the national assembly in 1985 (compared with
less than 15 percent in 1965). With better political
representation---across the political spectrum---came more attention to
issues that were especially important for women, such as child care,
contraception and abortion, and the right to divorce. By the end of the
Cold War, women were still discriminated against in terms of pay and
career patterns (less than 15 percent of top executives in leading US
companies are female even today). But the Communist argument that only
socialism could end the unfair treatment of women had been proven false.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-381}<strong>T[HE ACHIEVEMENTS OF]{.small-caps}</strong>
social movements in the capitalist West did not prevent many political
leaders from seeing the 1960s as a decade of increasing chaos and
dislocation. The autonomy that many campaigning groups sought for
themselves fueled elite concerns about society becoming ungovernable.
Over time this pushed in the direction of finding new ways of
stabilizing the Cold War, of making it less disruptive and dangerous, at
least in Europe and in the relationship between the Superpowers. None of
the events of the late 1960s seemed to push in the direction of an
immediate Superpower confrontation, or a conflict across the division
lines in Europe. No American thought that the Soviet Union was about to
intervene in their all-consuming obsession, the war in Vietnam. And the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 showed that even if western
Europeans protested the crimes of the USSR, they were not up to doing
anything about them. The nadir of disinterest was reached by western
European student radicals, many of whom in 1968 were chanting not for
Dubček but for Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>From a western European and Superpower perspective the idea of
stabilizing the Cold War through a gradual lessening of tension between
the blocs made sense in the late 1960s. Such a détente could enable
leaders to better handle problems in their own societies, within their
alliances, and in the Third World. It would reduce the chance of nuclear
war and---crucially in a time when both the Americans and the Soviets
were feeling the sting of military expenditure---reduce the cost of
further military buildups. There were also those, at least in the West,
who thought the two ideological systems would converge over time.
Industrial society seemed to pose similar challenges to East and West,
the thinking went. Some of the solutions, through technology and social
engineering, were also likely to be similar, and therefore the states
that carried them out would come to look more like each other, even if
the political context was different.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-382}The attempts at stabilizing the Cold War
through a lasting détente began in Europe in the early 1960s. France's
President de Gaulle---always upset at the thought of Superpower
bipolarity and seeking a greater role for France in international
affairs---attempted to reach out to the East on his own. Having
successfully tested France's first nuclear weapon in 1960, de Gaulle
felt that France should defend its foreign policy independence, even
within the NATO alliance. The French president, a conservative with a
deep-seated sense of the cultural unity of Europe, believed that the
United States had become too predominant in the relationship with its
partners. He wanted to see a more independent western Europe, under
French leadership, that could balance the American role in NATO. De
Gaulle's famous <em>non</em> to British attempts at joining the increasingly
integrationist European Economic Community was based on his sense of
London as a Trojan horse for Washington. France was the only country
that could lead a more independent western Europe, de Gaulle thought,
while keeping the US security guarantee and building bridges with the
East.</p>
<p>In 1964, the French president began a more active program for technical
and cultural cooperation with eastern Europe and with the Soviet Union.
His aim, he declared at a dramatic press conference on the twentieth
anniversary of the Yalta conference in 1965, was to overcome "Yalta" and
bring an end to the division of Europe. "The reappearance of the nation
with its hands free, which we again have become, clearly changes the
global game, which, since Yalta, seemed henceforth limited to two
partners."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en369en">^14^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en369} The
French president followed up with visits to Moscow, Warsaw, and
Bucharest, where he received a hero's welcome from the regimes after he
abruptly withdrew France from NATO's integrated military command in
1966. Europe's future, the general declared, was not in a bipolarity
dominated by the Superpowers, but in "détente, entente, and
cooperation." The practical results of de Gaulle's policies, however,
were few and far between. And by 1968 both Moscow and Washington took
some pleasure in seeing de Gaulle's grandeur humbled by the May events.
When he resigned the following year, after losing a referendum on
administrative reform, those who found solace in the European status quo
drew a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-383}The reason why the Americans, though
annoyed, could more or less disregard de Gaulle's shenanigans was that
the future of the European component of NATO seemed secure. President
Johnson knew that the last thing the French president wanted, in spite
of his complaints about "Yalta," was a US withdrawal from Europe.
Johnson's hope, especially in light of rising US military expenditure in
Indochina, was to get western Europe (and Japan) to carry more of the
economic burden for their defense themselves. But LBJ did not believe
that the United States ought to withdraw forces from Europe. When the
Democratic leader of the Senate, Mike Mansfield, put forward a
resolution calling for substantial troop reductions in Europe, Johnson
scoffed to his staff: "I'm not one of those folks that are just sucked
in by the Russians. I don't believe in the... whole goddamned theory
that it's all over there.... I think those sons of bitches want to eat
us any day they
can."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en370en">^15^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en370}</p>
<p>Johnson did believe, however, that Germany was less of an immediate Cold
War issue because of West Germany's safe anchoring in NATO. While de
Gaulle huffed and hawed and students---not least in West
Germany---protested against US imperialism, both main parties in the
Federal Republic, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, saw
their country's continued integration with the West as crucial for
Germany's future. Indeed, de Gaulle's insistence on building his "new
Europe" around a French-German axis seemed to confirm West Germany's
place. Western European economic integration became an instrument both
for further growth and for Cold War cohesion. Increasingly, the European
integration project had West Germany's spectacular industrial and
commercial success as its center. By 1970 the West German economy was
almost 40 percent bigger than the French, and 65 percent bigger than the
British economy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-384}Placing the German economic dynamo at the
heart of European integration made good sense, both in terms of
economics and politics. The 1957 Treaty of Rome had created a European
Economic Community (EEC), which committed the members---Belgium, France,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany---to set up a
common market for goods, capital, and workers. In spite of Gaullist
challenges and a slow, sometimes infuriating process of negotiation, ten
years later the removal of internal tariffs was complete, with a full
customs union inside what then was called the European Communities. The
secret of the success was twofold. One was internal: allowing West
Germany the free export of its industrial goods in return for it
contributing heavily to subsidies for French and Italian farmers, the
so-called Common Agricultural Policy. The other was external: the sense,
in all western European capitals, that Europe could only regain a strong
voice within the Cold War if it was more united.</p>
<p>It was therefore the combination of German economic strength and the
Europeanization of Gaullist principles that under Cold War conditions
created the new push toward European integration. After de Gaulle's
resignation in 1969, Britain was allowed to reopen negotiations to join
the EEC, and it joined, after a referendum, along with Denmark, in 1973.
By then it was clear that the Communities would be the future of
European integration, and that the European Free Trade Association, the
other European trade bloc that Britain had cultivated as a less
integrationist alternative, could not deliver the connection to European
markets that Britain wanted. Britain's accession also convinced the
Americans that they had little to fear, except perhaps in economic
terms, from further western European integration. Britain in the EEC
made the common market more of a European economic wing of NATO,
increasing the attractiveness of the western European model for
countries farther east.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-385}West Germany's bigger role in Europe was
also on the agenda of that country's domestic politics. In the 1965
elections the head of the Social Democrats (SPD), Willy Brandt, had
argued for a policy of bridge-building with eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, both to further reduce military tension in Europe and to
prepare the way for negotiations on German reunification. When Brandt
became foreign minister in a grand coalition of Christian Democrats and
Social Democrats in 1966, he was in a position to put some of this
policy into practice. Having proven his anti-Communist credentials as
mayor of West Berlin, Brandt felt that he could reach out to the East
without creating a political backlash among West Germans who overall
prioritized further economic growth and increase in welfare provisions
over too much talk about German unity. It was going to be difficult,
Brandt told SPD members in 1967. It would be about small steps, not big
leaps. And a new West German eastern policy, <em>Ostpolitik</em>, was dependent
on "a western policy oriented towards a European peace
settlement."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en371en">^16^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en371}</p>
<p>The 1969 elections in West Germany made Willy Brandt <em>Bundeskanzler</em>,
the head of government. For the first time since 1930 a Social Democrat
was in power in Germany, and Brandt was determined to use the
opportunity both for domestic reform and for détente with the East. His
Ostpolitik had been developed gradually in conversations with his
closest advisers. Egon Bahr, whom Brandt had worked with in Berlin and
who became his point man in contacts with the East, had spoken of
<em>wandel durch annäherung</em> (change through rapprochement). This became a
good summing-up of Brandt's policy: a careful building of trust among
governments in the east and west of Europe, which would enable
disarmament, increased trade, travel, and cultural contacts, and,
eventually, German reunification and the full removal of Europe's Cold
War divides. It was less than revolutionary, as Brandt's critics Left
and Right were fond of pointing out. But it was also much more than
Europe could have hoped for only a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Brandt knew that the road to East Berlin went through Moscow. In
negotiations with Brezhnev in 1970, Brandt promised increased trade and
economic cooperation and a treaty with the Soviet Union in which both
sides agreed that the postwar borders in Europe, including the new
Polish-German border and the border between East and West Germany, were
inviolable. Brezhnev was delighted. A treaty with West Germany meant
reducing the fear of German revanchism, and, even more important, the
prospect that at some point a neutral Germany could tip the Cold War
balance in Europe toward the Soviet Union. The Soviet leader bristled at
those of his advisers who feared that the anti-Communist Brandt's aims
were more insidious, namely the gradual loosening of the bonds that tied
eastern Europe to the USSR. Even when Brandt before the signing of the
treaty handed Brezhnev a note that said "this agreement is not contrary
to the policy objective of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is to
work toward a condition of peace in Europe under which the German people
will regain its unity through free self-determination," the general
secretary did not
demur.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en372en">^17^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en372} It was
just words, Brezhnev argued. Germany needed the Soviet Union much more
than the Soviets needed Germany.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-386}If it had not been for the new Nixon
Administration itself engaging in renewed efforts at détente with the
Soviets, Brandt's policy could have been seen as positively treacherous
in a NATO context. As things were, the Bundeskanzler could claim that he
was building on initiatives launched by France and then by the United
States itself. Even so, there was substantial weariness elsewhere in
Europe and in Washington over Brandt's actions. The questions were not
so much about what Brandt did now as with what his ultimate aim might
be. Did the German Social Democrats want to make a grand bargain with
the Soviets in return for reunification? If so, the future of the NATO
alliance could be at stake. But Brandt was clever enough to use his
credentials as a pro-American European, a man who had fought against his
own country in World War II, in order to reduce the effects of these
doubts, even if they never entirely went away.</p>
<p>Brandt followed up his Moscow treaty with a separate treaty with Poland,
later in 1970. In it, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) restated its
acceptance of Poland's western border and promised further peaceful
cooperation between the two governments. But the most important aspect
of the negotiations was Brandt's December 1970 visit to Warsaw.
Insisting on going to the memorial for the 1943 uprising against German
occupation in the Warsaw Jewish ghetto, Brandt placed a wreath honoring
the resistance fighters. He then sank to his knees in the snow and
slush, and remained there, silently, in front of the TV cameras. For
Poles and others who watched in eastern Europe, it was a powerful symbol
of a new German government intent on peace, headed by a man of a new
generation who himself had no blame in Germany's wartime atrocities. It
went further than any treaty in creating an image of a new West Germany
for peoples in the east.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-387}While all of this happened, the Communists
in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) had been watching nervously from
the wings. While they welcomed a less confrontational West German
policy, they feared Brandt's immense popularity and his appeal among
Germans in the East. They also feared that he was going above their
heads when dealing with Moscow and Warsaw. To them, the achievements of
Ostpolitik seemed a bit like the late Stalin-era discussions in Moscow
about the purposes of the GDR. They refused to meet Brandt unless he
gave full diplomatic recognition to the GDR first. By 1972, however, it
was clear to Walter Ulbricht and the GDR leadership that they had to
negotiate with Brandt, both to avoid Moscow's displeasure and to avoid
undermining their position at home.</p>
<p>The result of these negotiations, mainly carried out by Egon Bahr on the
West German side, was the Basic Agreement between the two German states
in December 1972. To the East Germans the term "basic" meant that it
contained the minimum of what they had to do. To Brandt it signaled the
first step in a rapprochement between the FRG and the GDR. The treaty
contained a promise by each government to respect the jurisdiction of
the other on its territory and the mutual independence in international
affairs. They also pledged to cooperate on a whole set of issues,
ranging from science and sport to post and communications. The real
significance of the treaty was that for the first time in twenty-five
years the two German states were dealing directly with each other, even
if full recognition was not forthcoming. And Brandt was right about it
being a first step. Several other agreements between the two were
reached during the 1970s, making it unlikely that one would return to
the absolute confrontation of the earlier Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-388}Brandt therefore seemed to have achieved
quite a lot in his attempts at building bridges in Europe, even though
it is unlikely that he could have achieved half as much if it were not
for the overall spirit of détente in the early 1970s. The German
chancellor also had his detractors among those who claimed that he was
giving too much to the East and not standing up for human rights and
freedom of expression. While Brandt and his successors negotiated with
the East German authorities, forty-eight people were shot trying to
cross into West Berlin and eleven thousand were imprisoned for speaking
out against the Communist regime. What kind of change did the
rapprochement bring, critics asked? Maybe the real change was in West
Germany, where small extreme Left terrorist groups---secretly aided by
the GDR---made the country more difficult to govern?</p>
<p>Brandt's answer was that one could not deal effectively with the eastern
European governments if one at the same time was actively and openly
encouraging their populations to overthrow them. The breaking down of
Cold War divisions in Europe would take time, the Bundeskanzler argued.
What mattered in the meantime was to avoid war and build
people-to-people contacts. What Europe needed, Brandt argued at the UN
on the occasion of the admission of both German states, finally, to that
organization in 1973, was "a condition of day-to-day peace." The massive
military budgets on both sides had to be reduced: "If we do succeed in
reducing, through confidence building, the monstrous waste created by
the lack of trust between antagonistic systems, then we will have set a
historical example.... At the end of the Cold War... there will be
neither victors nor vanquished. The truth is, that if one wants to
achieve peace, one must not strive for victory for some and defeat for
others, but rather for the victory of reason and
moderation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en373en">^18^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en373}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-389}Brandt's vision of a more peaceful Europe,
so much based on his own experiences throughout the twentieth century,
also contributed to what was undoubtedly the greatest achievement of
European détente, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE). Back in the 1950s, the Soviets had launched a plan for an
all-European security organization to replace the power blocs. It was a
rather undisguised attempt at excluding the United States, as a
"non-European" power, from discussions on Europe's future. The western
Europeans saw it as such and rejected it out of hand. But in the late
1960s Soviet suggestions of talks found a better reception among
Europeans west and east. With new attempts in Washington and Moscow at
building a Superpower détente, European leaders were eager to avoid
decisions being taken above their heads. Brandt's Ostpolitik had reduced
the fear of Germany in eastern Europe. And, somewhat bizarrely, the
invasion of Czechoslovakia had convinced many that there was no
alternative to dealing with the Soviet Union if the partition of Europe
was to be overcome.</p>
<p>The CSCE process was firmly anchored in the continued existence of NATO
and the Warsaw Pact. But in spite of its skepticism both toward
Ostpolitik and the CSCE process, the new US Administration of Richard
Nixon was wise enough to let its European allies explore what was
possible. One clear condition, which the Soviets grudgingly accepted,
was the inclusion of the United States in the talks. Another was regular
NATO consultations both on process and positions. The western European
leaders had no problem accepting this framework. While eager to explore
what could be achieved with the East, none of them wanted too many
internal difficulties in the Western alliance.</p>
<p>The most surprising element on the road to the CSCE was the activism of
the eastern European governments. That the Romanians, as dissidents
within the bloc, came up with their own proposals was no surprise. But
that Poland and Hungary, which had shown their Soviet loyalism when
co-invading Prague in 1968, were eager to present their own plans for
the gradual dismantling of Europe's Cold War divides was more
astounding. Like the West, the East approached the talks through
consultations in the Warsaw Pact and other Communist fora. But by the
early 1970s it was clear that if the Soviets ordered a unilateral halt
to the process, there would be a considerable political price to pay in
eastern Europe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-390}By 1973 the Soviets found themselves in a
quandary. They had primarily wanted to use a negotiation process as a
propaganda weapon against the United States. But as the deepening of
their own engagement with the Americans proceeded and expectations for a
continent-wide security conference spread in Europe, they had little
choice but to go ahead with their participation. A number of smaller
western European countries, followed by France, insisted on human rights
and freedom of speech issues becoming part of the negotiations,
alongside military confidence-building and economic cooperation. These
then became "Basket III" of the negotiation process when, to everyone's
surprise, the Soviets agreed to their inclusion. Brezhnev regarded
talking about Basket III issues a small price to pay for making some
headway on other concerns. Knowing how much the general secretary wanted
an agreement, even the KGB concluded that "Basket III is dependent upon
our interpretation.... These will be practical steps of the party and
the organs of state security. Basket III gives no one the possibility of
intervening in the internal affairs of another state. There are many
references there to domestic
legislation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en374en">^19^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en374}</p>
<p>The ratification of the Helsinki Final Act of the CSCE in mid-1975 was
the high point of European détente. For Brezhnev it was the highlight of
his political career. Thirty-five countries agreed to a Declaration on
Principles Guiding Relations between Participating States. These
principles included sovereign equality, inviolability of frontiers, and
nonintervention in domestic affairs. All were propositions that the
Soviets had put forward since the founding of their state. But the Final
Act also included key paragraphs on the rights of the individual. The
signatories, it declared,</p>

<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-391}Brezhnev told himself and others that it
was just language, that it did not matter much. But in Cold War terms
the Helsinki Final Act was to have consequences far beyond what anyone

<p><strong>A[S]{.small-caps} E[UROPEANS STRUGGLED]{.small-caps}</strong> with managing
their Cold War inheritance, the Third World project split further apart.
With the enthusiasm for freedom and new opportunities now tempered by
harsh postcolonial realities, the concepts of solidarity and
transnational South-South cooperation developed during the anticolonial
struggle receded into the past in most places. After the political
turnarounds in the mid-1960s, most postcolonial governments prioritized
their own state's interests and their own plans for economic development
over the wider cooperation and cohesion imagined by Nehru, Nkrumah, or
Sukarno. Countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America could still
cooperate against Cold War constrictions and against European
predominance. But such cooperation would now be more narrowly conceived,
and based primarily on each country's strategic or economic interests.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development in 1964, a group of seventy-seven non-European countries
promised to consult further among themselves on trade-related issues. At
its first meeting as the Group of 77 in Algeria three years later, the
new organization issued the Algiers Charter, which called for fairer
prices for raw materials, acceptance of principles of political and
legal sovereignty in global trade, and more open and equitable world
markets. "The lot of more than a billion people of the developing world
continues to deteriorate as a result of the trends in international
economic relations," the charter noted.</p>

<p>Western European governments saw connections between their own wishes to
reduce Cold War tensions in Europe and hopes in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America for a more stable economic development. One point was to avoid
revolutionary turbulence that could further complicate the global Cold
War. Another, especially among European Social Democrats such as Willy
Brandt and Sweden's Olof Palme, was that the Group of 77 was right in
seeing global development as interconnected, irrespective of political
and economic systems. In his 1973 UN speech, Brandt had underlined
exactly this dimension by stressing that it would not much gain the
West---and especially the Europeans---if East-West conflicts were
replaced by North-South conflicts. By the early 1970s the Group of 77
and other organizations working with it had developed a plan through
which a fairer world economy could be initiated through the United
Nations. The somewhat grandiosely termed New International Economic
Order (NIEO), passed by a majority vote in the UN General Assembly in
1974, called for the right of states to control the extraction of their
natural resources through state-managed resource cartels. It also wanted
to see the regulation of transnational corporations, technology
transfers from north to south, trade preferences, and debt forgiveness.
In all, the NIEO charter aimed to create what Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere called a "trade union of the poor." Others called it, less
charitably but probably more accurately, "socialism among states." The
United States, predictably, rejected the demands, with its UN ambassador
condemning the resolution as a "steamroller" representing the "tyranny
of the
majority."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en377en">^22^</a>{#chapter014.xhtml#en377}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter014.xhtml#page-393}The demands for a New International
Economic Order did have some positive effects. Pushed by Brandt and
others, the EEC entered into a set of conventions with former European
colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. These so-called Lomè Conventions,
named after the Togolese capital, allowed duty-free imports into the EEC
and set off \$3.6 billion (almost \$13.5 billion today) in aid and
investment. But overall the immediate results were negative. By focusing
on economic demands, the ailing Third World coalition blew itself apart.
Countries that were dependent on cheap raw material imports for their
burgeoning industries, say, Singapore, found that they had little in
common with countries that relied on improving raw material prices, say,
Zambia. Oil exporters found that their interests often clashed with
those dependent on cheap oil. The 1970s therefore became a decade in
which global economic as well as political roles changed dramatically,
with considerable and sustained effects for how the Cold War was fought.

<p>While the 1960s began changes that would transform Europe, the 1970s saw
a metamorphosis that transformed Asia and with it, gradually, the world.
Although China sidelined itself through its Cultural Revolution, other
Asian countries had been preparing for an economic takeoff within the
capitalist world system dominated by the United States. Japan had been
in the forefront. During the 1960s its economy had grown 11 percent per
year, one of the fastest growth rates ever known for what was, in
essence, already a developed economy. But from the late 1960s other
Asian countries joined Japan in rapid growth, borrowing some aspects of
its export-driven economic principles. Within the span of a decade,
South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore went from being poor, resourceless
countries to economic dynamos, mainly on the strength of their
integrated industrial enterprises, government guidance, and hardworking,
well-educated labor forces.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that all the "little tigers" of the rapidly growing
east Asian economy were close political allies of the United States.
Just like in the case of Japan, Cold War alliance with Washington meant
access to US and other Western markets on preferential terms. It also
meant that east Asian authoritarian governments, helped by US advisers
and military support, could defend themselves against rebellions among
their own populations. None of the American links would have been enough
by themselves to create east Asian economic growth. That was caused
mainly by domestic factors. Neither is it true, as sometimes claimed,
that the US war in Vietnam bought time for successful capitalist
industrialization elsewhere in Asia. In execution, as well as in
consequence, these were unrelated phenomena, even though the demand for
goods created by the Indochina wars did stimulate other economies in the
region. But, in overall terms, the Cold War did help to make export-led
growth a surer path to quick economic transformation, thereby creating
global economic interaction on an ever-larger scale.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-396}<strong>I[N THE 1970S,]{.small-caps}</strong> many
Americans grew increasingly fearful that the resurgence of western
Europe and rapid growth in parts of Asia meant the loss of jobs and
income in the United States. And in relative terms the US economy was
becoming less predominant. In 1945 the United States had contributed a
full third of the global economy. In 1970 the figure was less than a
quarter and dropping. This ought not to have been surprising. Right
after World War II all main competitors had been in ruins. A generation
later they had rebuilt and could therefore compete more effectively.
What really worried US policy-makers was their own country's combination
of low domestic growth rates and high government expenditure, especially
on defense. In 1970 the Japanese economy grew 10.7 percent, and the West
German 2.6 percent. The US economy grew only 0.5 percent. The
competitors were also catching up in terms of overall productivity.</p>
<p>In 1971 the US government acted to defend its own economic interest. By
abruptly suspending the fixed rate of exchanging dollars for gold, it in
effect devalued the US dollar against other currencies, helping American
exporters and domestic business. It thereby deliberately destroyed the
Bretton Woods system, in which most other currencies had been pegged to
the dollar at a fixed exchange rate. For the first time since 1945 US
leaders looked more to their own bottom line than to preserving and
integrating the world economic system. Of course, it could be argued
that successive US Administrations had upheld that system, because it
first and foremost served the American economy. But by the early 1970s
this seemed to no longer to be the case. The global economy entered a
new and turbulent era.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-397}The collapse of Bretton Woods had a
significant effect on the Cold War. The global economy had been stable
in terms of its structure since the late 1940s. Of course there had been
fluctuations, both in volume and in profits. But it had been stable in
the sense that the capitalist economies had gradually become more
integrated through their common dependence on the US dollar. Although a
slow process, it had facilitated the recovery of western Europe and
Japan. It had also deflated the price of raw materials, giving
industrialized countries an edge. So while the protection and expansion
of the global capitalist system had been a core US objective in the Cold
War, its pursuit of this aim had been hegemonic, not particularistic.
The success of capitalism drove US policies much more than concerns
about the profitability of American companies or even foreign
expenditures of the American state.</p>
<p>All of this changed in the "long 1970s," from 1968 to 1982 or
thereabouts. While the unsuccessful war in Indochina created a sense of
US political and military weakness, unilateral action to prop up its own
economic interests made the United States seem less predominant and more
self-serving. These perceptions may have been less than true overall,
but they were widely held at the time, both inside and outside the
United States itself. More important than perceptions, though, were the
new realities created by economic and technological change. The collapse
of Bretton Woods and the floating of exchange rates were not a cause but
a symptom of a global reshaping. In the capitalist West, the
state-centered, tariff-oriented, capital-controls-dominated postwar
world was giving way to international trade and international finance.
World trade tripled from the mid-1960s to 1980, much helped by more
effective forms of transport and by large amounts of currency,
especially US dollars, held outside its country of origin. Overseas
investments also increased dramatically, in part because improved
communications provided investors with more information and therefore
increased confidence. In the 1970s, capitalism went global, with
consequences few could foresee. Over time, the United States would be a
big beneficiary of this so-called "globalization." But at the beginning
of the process this was hard to imagine, not least for Americans
themselves, who felt that their country was slipping behind.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-398}<strong>T[HE]{.small-caps} US
[ELECTIONS]{.small-caps}</strong> of 1968---like those in France the same
year---delivered a conservative result on the back of deep societal
upheaval. The civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the
Democratic front-runner for their party's nomination as president,
Robert F. Kennedy, the late president's brother, were both assassinated
in the lead-up to the elections. Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate
who had served as Eisenhower's vice president for eight years, was
elected in a sharply fought three-way race. Nixon had the lowest
percentage of popular votes since Woodrow Wilson in 1912. In his
campaign, he had appealed to "the silent majority" who were afraid of
change, tumult, and foreign wars. "We hear sirens in the night," he told
his party's convention. "We see Americans dying on distant battlefields
abroad. We see Americans hating each other; fighting each other; killing
each other at home." Nixon promised stability in America and "an
honorable peace" in Vietnam. His supporters, he said, would be "the
great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans---the non-shouters;
the non-demonstrators. They are not racists or sick," Nixon assured
them, "they are not guilty of the crime that plagues the
land."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en378en">^1^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en378}</p>
<p>To those who knew him, Nixon often stood out as small-minded and
insecure, but by 1969 he had enormous political experience. His sense of
desperation over his country's future made him an imaginative foreign
policy-maker, who was willing to break barriers. Nixon wanted to fight
and win the Cold War. But, alone among recent presidents, he thought of
the United States as one country among many in the international system.
It was the most powerful country, at least for now. But Nixon did not
trust the American people, and especially its youth, to be willing to
pay the price that Superpower status implied in the time ahead. He
worried about a future in which lack of internal cohesion and the rise
of powerful and more purposeful challengers could destroy US
predominance. His policies of détente were intended to postpone that day
and make an uncertain future more predictable and therefore less
dangerous for the United States.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-399}Nixon had made his name as a conservative
Cold Warrior. His election campaign had been filled with pledges of
restoring American greatness and with more than a whiff of prejudice
against racial minorities at home and foreigners out to exploit the
United States. But he knew that he would have to govern by leaving
behind many of the tones he had struck in the campaign. Domestically,
the new president kept most of the social reforms of the Johnson years,
and even expanded some of them. Internationally, he, from the very
beginning of his presidency, wanted to reshape the global framework so
the United States could keep its preeminence at a lower cost than
before. And Nixon knew that in order to do so, he would need to sit down
with the Soviet leaders and negotiate some kind of temporary Cold War
truce.</p>
<p>In his first instructions to his national security adviser, Harvard
professor Henry Kissinger, Nixon underlined how all actions in foreign
policy were connected. The new president's top priority was to disengage
the United States from the wars in Indochina. But he felt that the road
to get there did not go primarily through peace negotiations with Hanoi,
but through Moscow and Beijing. Already before he became president,
Nixon had begun thinking about exploring some form of relaxation of
tension with China. In a 1967 article in the influential journal
<em>Foreign Affairs</em>, he had argued that outside of Indochina, Asia was
really a great success story from a US perspective. It had rapidly
modernizing states with strong economic growth. Sooner or later China
would join the others. "We simply cannot afford to leave China forever
outside the family of nations.... There is no place on this small planet
for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry
isolation," Nixon
argued.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en379en">^2^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en379} If China
wanted to talk, Nixon was ready to listen.</p>
<p><strong>N[IXON WAS RIGHT]{.small-caps}</strong> about the rest of Asia, or at least
about some countries in its eastern half. It had taken longer there than
in Europe to overcome the effects of war. But by the time Nixon was
elected, domestically driven market economies were starting to transform
the lives of people in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It
was hard to see the significance of this at the time. The Vietnam War
overshadowed most other developments. And some bigger countries were
barely affected by the changes, at least to begin with: China by choice,
others by indigence. But the entry of Asia's "little tigers" into the
capitalist world economy was to change the bigger picture, not least in
terms of the global economic significance of eastern Asia. And none of
this would have happened without the strictures and apertures of the
Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-400}Japan was the forerunner for much of this
development. It provided a model, even though the other market economies
were hardly just copies of the Japanese experience. When the United
States ended its occupation of Japan in 1951, very few people in Asia or
elsewhere would have predicted a glorious economic future for the island
nation. Annual growth was slowing and political deadlock between Right
and Left made the country hard to govern. But two things were happening
that were going to change the future. The Japanese Right began to put
aside its internal infighting, meaning that conservatives who had
supported the war and those few who had seen it as a disaster joined in
the same party. Their somewhat incongruously named Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) defeated the Left and established a political hegemony that
lasted thirty-five years. The new government's industrial policy
emphasized increasing productivity (in part by curbing the power of the
trade unions) and a strong role for the state in guiding investment,
production, and foreign exports.</p>
<p>At the same time as Japan got a stable government that emphasized
long-term economic growth, some of the fundaments of expansion in the
private sector started to come together. US needs during the Korean War
had made some sectors of Japanese industry very profitable. Guided by
the government, the big companies, the <em>zaibatsu</em>, used their profits to
invest in rationalization and new technology. Meanwhile, the Eisenhower
Administration---fearful of the influence of the Japanese
Left---smoothed the way for Japanese exports not only to the United
States, but to western Europe and southeast Asia as well. Few of the
recipient countries were thrilled at the prospect of opening their
markets to cheap imports from a former enemy. But the Americans
insisted, telling them that strategic interests had to take priority
over short-term balance-of-trade issues. US policy toward Japan, said a
1960 National Security Council (NSC) directive, encouraged "a strong,
healthy, self-supporting and expanding economy which will permit
improvement in Japan's living standards, provide more capital for the
development of less-developed nations, and make a greater contribution
to the strength of the Free
World."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en380en">^3^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en380}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-401}1960 was the year of decision for the
future of Japan. With the renewal of the US-Japanese Security Treaty
pending, the Japanese Left mobilized its waning forces in an attempt to
defeat it in parliament. The parliamentary clash over the future of the
treaty set off protests by trade unionists, students, and government
employees, who felt that the LDP had ridden rough-shod over their
interests. The crisis led to violence on the streets and the
cancellation of a planned visit by President Eisenhower. While it
neither toppled the government nor blocked security treaty renewal, the
1960 crisis told the LDP grandees that they had to make Japan's
reindustrialization more socially inclusive. The party got rid of Prime
Minister Kishi Nobusuke, a wartime minister of munitions who had been
all too eager to settle old scores with the Left. The new LDP government
insisted that welfare for all was the aim of its economic policy, and
promised that everyone's personal income would double within ten years.</p>
<p>With the Japanese economy now growing at double-digit figures, it took
only seven years to realize the income doubling plan. During the 1960s
and '70s Japan transformed itself from the sick man of the
industrialized world to its foremost economic powerhouse. Helped by
liberalizing trade regimes, government credit and export guidance, and
strong and cohesive companies, Japan's access to international markets
propelled it to become the world's second-largest economy and a global
leader in technology and productivity by 1970. In 1960 Charles de Gaulle
had disparagingly written off the visiting Japanese prime minister as a
"transistor salesman." Twenty years later the Japanese economy was twice
the size of France's and its productivity a staggering 25 percent
higher.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en381en">^4^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en381}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-402}<strong>T[O MANY IN]{.small-caps}</strong> the West,
Japan was still the exception that proved the rule of Asian
underdevelopment. As late as the mid-1960s, when President Johnson made
his fateful decision to send US ground troops to Vietnam, a commonly
held view was that the rest of Asia would fall further and further
behind North America, western Europe, and even the resource-rich states
of the Middle East and Africa. The Asian countries were overpopulated,
under-resourced, and very badly governed, argued US experts. This, in a
sense, was why they were prime targets for Communist aggression and had
to be defended by the United States. Asia was a region for Cold War
expansion, not because of its importance but because of its weakness.</p>
<p>Those who held such views had not done their homework on South Korea,
Taiwan, or the city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore. In 1954 South
Korea had been the poorest country in eastern Asia, devastated by three
years of war in which the front lines had moved through the whole
country several times. Everyone had been affected by the cataclysm. Its
GDP per capita was behind that of Ghana or Kenya and showed no sign of
improving. But during the 1960s things changed, laying the groundwork
for a massive economic expansion in the 1970s and '80s. The same can be
said for Taiwan, a rump Chinese state ruled by refugees from mainland
China. Some parts of their stories are similar to Japan's: state-led
development, export-oriented growth, and high domestic savings rates.
But others are distinct: the emphasis on building education, in some
cases almost from scratch; the significance of social programs and
welfare from the beginning of the economic expansion; and the rule of
"development dictatorships," governed with an iron fist by their
military leaders.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and Taiwan were front-line states in the Cold War. US
assistance to both was significant. Between 1946 and 1978 South Korea
received almost as much US aid as all of Africa put
together.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en382en">^5^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en382} But
easy access to US and Japanese markets was at least as important. In
1970 three-quarters of South Korea's exports went to the United States
or Japan.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en383en">^6^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en383} The
middle part of the Cold War obviously gave the two economic
opportunities that they otherwise would not have had. But it also posed
challenges. The dictatorships were held in place in part by their access
to US aid, including significant military assistance. The most important
point, though, is that South Korea and Taiwan took the opportunities
offered to them and made good use of their unanticipated advantage.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-403}The same can be said, to an even higher
degree, for Singapore and Hong Kong. Two unloved (and some would say
unwashed) cities that had lost their strategic importance with the
decline of the British empire saw it revived by the Cold War. Hong Kong
became a listening post against China, ruled up to the end of the Cold
War by Britain, in part in order to share its information cachet with
the Americans. Singapore became, first, an unhappy member of the
Malaysian federation, and then, from 1964, when they were thrown out of
Malaysia, an independent city-state. From the birth of sovereign
Singapore, its leader Lee Kuan Yew believed that, with the British
leaving, only a US presence could save his new country. "Anyone who was
not a Communist and wanted to see the US leave Southeast Asia was a
fool," Lee told Indian prime minister Indira
Gandhi.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en384en">^7^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en384} Although
of Chinese extraction himself, Lee feared Chinese dominance of his
region.</p>
<p>But Singapore's real Cold War significance, at least in symbolic terms,
was the degree to which the former labor organizer Lee Kuan Yew broke
with ideals of Third World solidarity, which had much appealed to him in
his youth, and moved toward market-led domestic development. At
independence, Singapore had been dirt poor. It had no resources except
its population. The US presence in his region provided both security and
economic opportunity for Lee. By the early 1970s he no longer had any
time for Third World demands for higher raw material prices or political
nonalignment. Lee decided that only by embracing global markets could
Singapore become rich and he himself more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>W[HILE OTHER EAST]{.small-caps}</strong> Asian countries experienced growth
within a US-led world system, Mao's People's Republic of China had been
exploring the depths of Marxist political rectitude. Although not the
same kind of economic disaster as the Great Leap Forward campaign a
decade earlier, the Cultural Revolution isolated China further from the
world around it. It also quickly ran into trouble at home. While
screaming students were carrying out Mao's orders to "bombard the
headquarters" and senior Communists were dragged through the streets or
punished as criminals, the country became increasingly ungovernable.
With key functions such as railways or telephone services increasingly
out of order, mainly because their staff was being hauled away for
political reeducation, the Chairman started to worry about China's
preparedness against a foreign attack. By 1969 many of the craziest
aspects of the Cultural Revolution---public torture sessions, all-day
political meetings, constant shouting of slogans---were brought to a
halt, in part through the use of the army against Red Guard activists.
Labor camps and reeducation sites remained, now sometimes populated by
those who had been the Chairman's strongest supporters when the Cultural
Revolution began. Even if Maoist terror was still in place, the
political landscape in China was gradually changing.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-404}Part of the reason for Mao's change of
heart was a shift in his views of the Cold War. In 1965 Mao's main
foreign preoccupation had been with the US intervention in Vietnam. But
while he had predicted further American involvement there, he was
surprised by the scale of it. Mao believed that the North Vietnamese
stood no chance of winning without direct Chinese support, as in Korea.
And, in the midst of Cultural Revolution chaos, he was loath to get into
another war against the most powerful country on earth. But like Stalin
in the Korean case, neither did the Chairman see any disadvantage in
having the Americans bogged down in Indochina. When Hanoi in 1968, in
the wake of the failed Tet offensive, agreed to tentative talks with the
Johnson Administration, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai lambasted them for
compromising the cause and imperiling their position. "Before their
backbone has been broken, or before five or six of their fingers have
been broken, [the Americans] will not accept defeat, and they will not
leave," he told Xuan Thuy, the North Vietnamese chief negotiator. He
even accused Hanoi's concessions of having caused both the murder of
Martin Luther King Jr. and a stock market rise in the United States (a
very bad thing in Chinese
eyes).<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en385en">^8^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en385} No wonder
that Le Duan, now convinced that Beijing wanted to fight the Vietnam War
to the last Vietnamese, turned increasingly to their other sponsor, the
Soviet Union, for assistance.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-405}As in so many other matters, Mao Zedong's
own actions brought about the results he feared the most. By late 1968
his attention had turned almost exclusively to the Soviet threat to
China. The USSR, he believed, was the rising Superpower, while the
United States was the declining one. Together they were completing the
encirclement of China. China had to break out of the siege. Intent on
showing Moscow that China did not fear its military might, Mao ordered
Chinese soldiers to patrol disputed areas along the Sino-Soviet border.
The Soviet countermeasures fueled Beijing's war scare of 1969.</p>
<p>That summer, fearful of a Soviet nuclear attack, Mao hauled four of his
old military comrades back from the hovels to which they had been sent
during the Cultural Revolution and ordered them to write a
no-holds-barred secret report on China's international options. Entitled
"A Preliminary Evaluation of the War Situation," their report began,
prudently, by confirming Mao's worldview: the Superpowers hated China
because of its successful Communism and the gains of its Cultural
Revolution. The Soviet Union was, at the moment, more dangerous to China
than the United States. War with the Soviets was coming, though it would
not happen immediately. The Americans would prefer to see the two fight
each other. "By 'sitting on top of the mountain to watch a fight between
two tigers,' they will see the weakening of both China and the Soviet
Union."</p>
<p>The four old marshals stressed the urgency of the situation. They
compared it to China's position just prior to the Japanese attack in
1937. China, they said, had to improve its defensive stance. Although
the Soviets and the Americans shared some interests, the conflict
between them was "real and concrete." And Nixon, obsessed with the
Vietnam War, "takes China as a 'potential threat,' rather than a real
threat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en386en">^9^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en386} Chen Yi,
Nie Rongzhen, and the other marshals sensibly left Mao to draw his own
conclusions. But their implication, that China may want to reduce its
conflict with the United States in order to fight the Soviet Union, was
clear.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-406}<strong>I[N]{.small-caps}

had wasted no time in getting his new China initiatives going. Shocked
by the Sino-Soviet border clashes in the spring of 1969 and fearful they
could lead to nuclear war, he also saw huge opportunities for the United
States. By the summer he had instructed US diplomats to signal that the
United States was open to talks with Beijing. He also lessened trade and
travel restrictions on the People's Republic. With a view to exit from
the war in Indochina and improve relations with the Chinese, Nixon told
South Vietnamese president Nguyen Van Thieu that the United States in
the future would continue to support anti-Communist governments in Asia,
but would not intervene to help them with its own troops. He then took
off on a whirlwind tour around the world, meeting leaders in Pakistan
and---as the first US president---in Communist Romania. In both places
Nixon told his hosts in very direct language that he wanted to talk to
Beijing, and asked for their help in relaying the message to Mao and
Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>With a new high in Sino-Soviet tension in the fall, and before the
Chinese had responded to his feelers, Nixon began thinking about the
longer-term implications of reaching out to China. With an eye always on
domestic politics, the president realized that Soviet threats against
China would make a moderation of US-China policy easier to accept by the
American public. But he also told the NSC that the only country that
could threaten the United States in the long run was the Soviet Union.
Therefore, Nixon asked his team, "we must think through whether it is a
safer world with China down, or should we look to keeping China
strong?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en387en">^10^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en387} These
were revolutionary thoughts by an American president, and indicated a
plan that only Richard Nixon, with his conservative domestic record,
could have any hope of achieving.</p>
<p>After the war scare of 1969 abated, the Chinese leaders held back from
welcoming Nixon's overtures too openly. Mao's focus returned to domestic
affairs and to the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. Beijing was
worried that Nixon was setting a trap for them, and that the real aim of
his China policy was just to make it simpler for the United States to
win the war in Vietnam. Nixon's attacks into Cambodia and Laos in 1970,
undertaken primarily to cut off North Vietnam's supply lines to the
south, seemed to confirm this view. Mao condemned Nixon's "Fascist
aggression" and agreed to host Cambodia's exiled king, Sihanouk, in
Beijing. Little concrete therefore happened in the Sino-American
relationship at first, even though it was clear that new foundations had
been laid for the future.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-407}President Nixon was in some ways lucky
that his China initiatives took some time to play themselves out. After
all, his primary target for a global relaxation of tension was the
Soviet Union, not China. And the Soviets had told him very directly
about their wariness of any US messing about with their former Chinese
clients. The veteran Soviet ambassador to the United States, Anatolii
Dobrynin, had given the president a message from Moscow, which included
stark warnings. "If someone in the United States is tempted to make
profit from Soviet-Chinese relations at the Soviet Union's expense, and
there are some signs of that, then we would like to frankly warn in
advance that such line of conduct, if pursued, can lead to a very grave
miscalculation and is in no way consistent with the goal of better
relations between the US and the
USSR."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en388en">^11^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en388} Nixon
hoped that the Soviets and the Chinese would attempt to overbid each
other in a search for America's good graces. But at the same time he had
to be careful not to play the China card in such a way that he upset the
more important game, that with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Nixon wanted to find a stable balance in relations with the Soviets, at
least for the immediate future. His aim was to reduce the risk of war
and, over time, socialize Moscow into the international system that the
United States had created. The Soviet Union, Nixon believed, was a
postrevolutionary state, whose state interests counted for more than its
ideology. As long as the Soviets did not challenge the global power of
the United States, the president was happy to recognize it as the other
Superpower and let it keep its hegemony in eastern Europe. The Russian
leadership of the Soviet Union was, after all, fellow Europeans, Nixon
concluded. They were easier to talk to, and through, than assorted Third
World radicals, including those in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-408}But Nixon's détente policy toward the
Soviet Union also took time to put in place. Although Brezhnev was eager
for a stabilization of relations with the United States, there were many
points of conflict that got in the way. The Soviet Union, Brezhnev
insisted, would not accept a position of subservience to the United
States in return for peace. It would continue to set its own positions
in world politics on a global scale and defend socialism
internationally, including in Cuba and the Middle East. Even in getting
an agreement on limiting the number of strategic nuclear missiles, which
Brezhnev himself had called for in the past, the Soviets would not be
rushed. In Moscow, leaders believed circumstances favored them. "We got
time," Brezhnev told his colleagues. "The Americans... try to push us.
Now, we will not abandon the talks, but neither will we drive them
forward."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en389en">^12^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en389} By
1971, with his reelection campaign coming up, Nixon was getting
impatient, especially on the nuclear talks. "Just make any kind of a
damn deal," he told Henry Kissinger. "You know it doesn't make a goddamn
bit of difference. We're going to agree to settle it
anyway."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en390en">^13^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en390}</p>
<p>It was Brezhnev's foot-dragging that pushed Nixon toward the greatest
gamble of his political career. In April 1971 Mao had finally decided to
respond to Nixon's overtures. Through the Pakistanis, he invited the
president to visit Beijing for direct talks with the Chinese leadership.
Nixon immediately decided to accept. He thought that reaching out to
Beijing would put necessary pressure both on the Soviets and the North
Vietnamese. "The difference between [the Chinese] and the Russians,"
Henry Kissinger explained, "is that if you drop some loose change, when
you go to pick it up the Russians will step on your fingers and the
Chinese won't.... The Russians squeeze us on every bloody move and it
has just been
stupid."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en391en">^14^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en391}</p>
<p>In spite of Nixon's doubts about his national security adviser's
negotiating skills, he decided to send Kissinger to Beijing as his
advance man. The preparatory mission was to be secret, and Nixon knew
that sending Kissinger was his best bet to keep it that way. On 8 July
1971, Kissinger flew to Pakistan for well publicized meetings with the
leaders there. After the welcome reception on the first evening,
Kissinger feigned illness, and his spokesman told reporters that he
needed to rest outside Islamabad for a day or so. Instead, Kissinger
that night flew secretly on a Pakistani aircraft straight to Beijing,
where he was welcomed by Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. Awestruck at being
the first American leader to visit Communist China, Kissinger began
reading from a prepared text. Zhou cut him short. China, he said, was
hoping for "coexistence, equality, and friendship." But for that to
happen, the United States "must recognize the PRC as the sole legitimate
government of China and not make any exceptions. Just as we recognize
the United States as the sole legitimate government without considering
Hawaii, the last state, an exception to your sovereignty, or still less,
Long Island." In other words, the US relationship with Taiwan had to go.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-409}On 15 July, with Kissinger back from his
trip, Nixon astounded the world by going on live television to announce
that he would visit the People's Republic of China soon. His aim, he
said, was to further the cause of world peace. In Beijing the public
announcement was shocking for those who had grown up with
anti-Americanism as part of their basic beliefs. But it did strengthen
Zhou Enlai's position in the frenzied infighting that the Chinese regime
was going through due to the Cultural Revolution. As usual, Zhou had
succeeded in carrying out Mao's wishes. Suspecting that he was falling
out of favor, in part as a result of the US deal, Mao's designated
successor Lin Biao made a dash for the Soviet border, only to die when
the plane he was escaping on crashed in Mongolia. The chaos created by
Lin's defection and death in September 1971 postponed Nixon's visit. It
also reinforced Mao's hatred of the Soviet Union. Just like he had done
in the case of Liu Shaoqi, Mao linked Lin's betrayal to Soviet social
imperialism. Lin Biao had "wanted to compromise with the Soviet
revisionists in defiance of our party's efforts to expose and criticize
Soviet revisionism," Mao
claimed.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en392en">^15^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en392} When
asked by Romania's Ceauşescu, who had helped with contacting the
Americans, whether China, in due time, could also put things right with
Moscow, the Chairman was adamant: "We will not put anything right, and
will continue in our dogmatism; even [for] ten thousand
years."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en393en">^16^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en393}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-410}On 21 February 1972 Nixon arrived in
Beijing, the first US president ever to visit China. With arms
limitation talks with the Soviets still ongoing, and no end to the war
in Vietnam, the president needed a foreign policy success. He was
determined to make this the one. Mao was ill, recovering from a severe
lung infection, and only put in a brief appearance, during which he
rambled about his weakness and incapacity. When the president gushed
that "the Chairman's writings moved a nation and have changed the
world," Mao responded that he had "not been able to change it. I've only
been able to change a few places in the vicinity" of Beijing. Looking at
Nixon, Mao pronounced that he liked him. "I like Rightists," the
Chairman said. "I am comparatively happy when these people on the Right
come into power.... We were not very happy with these presidents, Truman
and Johnson."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en394en">^17^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en394}
Mao left the negotiations to Zhou, but kept a keen eye on what was
happening.</p>
<p>Speaking to Zhou as if he were a congressman whom the president needed
to win over to his side, Nixon stressed that the Chinese needed to deal
with him, the president, directly. Other US politicians would oppose the
understanding with China, Nixon said. Only he could deliver it. But in
order to do so he needed to keep even some of his own cabinet members in
the dark about what was going on. These included Secretary of State
William Rogers, whose department Nixon suspected of leaking documents to
the press in order to damage the president. Zhou listened to this
unexpected and ingratiating performance, saying very little.</p>
<p>Then the president jumped straight into his view of why the United
States and China had to cooperate. The Soviet Union was threatening
world peace. "I believe," Nixon told Zhou, that "the interests of China
as well as the interests of the U.S. urgently require that the U.S.
maintains its military establishment at approximately its present levels
and... [maintains] a military presence in Europe, in Japan, and of
course our naval forces in the Pacific. I believe the interests of China
are just as great as those of the U.S. on that point," Nixon said. To
him, the president explained, this was not about Taiwan, or east Asia,
or even about the Vietnam War. It was about global
stability.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en395en">^18^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en395}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-411}With Mao watching every move, it was hard
even for a seasoned diplomat like Zhou Enlai to come up with much that
the Americans wanted to hear, except attacks on the Soviets. On
Indochina, Zhou told Nixon that the United States should withdraw, but
that the Chinese would continue to support North Vietnam, the FNL, and
the Cambodian and Laotian Communists. Japan, the premier said, should
become "peaceful, independent, and neutral." Korea was an internal
matter, for the Koreans to decide. And Taiwan would be "liberated" by
the PRC after the United States broke its military links with Chiang
Kai-shek's regime, something Zhou hoped would happen during Nixon's
second term in office.</p>
<p>But Zhou did not have to offer much. Nixon needed a breakthrough with
China for his own reasons. He hoped the positive press coverage of the
visit in the United States would help him get reelected. But he also
hoped the Soviets and the North Vietnamese would be concerned enough
about the Sino-American contacts to seek their own settlements with
Washington. The final statement of the visit, the Shanghai Communiqué,
set out the views of the Chinese and US government separately at first.
But it then concluded that the two countries would continue to work
toward full normalization of their bilateral relations and cooperate on
trade and technology. On the crucial issue of Taiwan, the communiqué
made it clear that neither side wanted the island's future to be a
barrier to current Sino-American interactions:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the
Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part
of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.
It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan
question by the Chinese themselves. With this prospect in mind, it
affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and
military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will
progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as
the tension in the area
diminishes.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en396en">^19^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en396}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-412}As with most diplomatic breakthroughs,
neither side had fully got what they wanted. But Nixon was right about
the value for the United States of starting an open-ended process in
which China could be brought into play to serve American interests. Mao,
on his side, had obtained increased security against the Soviet Union
and at least some hope of recovering Taiwan soon. The Chairman remained
puzzled, however, about the ultimate aims of the Americans. He could not
understand why Nixon would support the "real" Communist revolution, his
revolution, against the fake Communists in Moscow. "Kissinger," Mao had
told the Vietnamese in 1970, "is a stinking scholar... a university
professor who does not know anything about
diplomacy."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en397en">^20^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en397} Five
years later, Mao accused Kissinger of "leaping to Moscow by way of our
shoulders."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en398en">^21^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en398}
There was limited cooperation but almost no trust in the relationship,
even after the Americans started to share highly sensitive intelligence
with the Chinese.</p>
<p>For the rest of the world, and especially the rest of Asia, the
breakthrough in Sino-American relations amounted to a strategic
earthquake. For more than twenty years, Washington had been telling the
Japanese, the South Koreans, and the southeast Asians that the Americans
were in Asia to protect them against the expansionist plans of Chinese
Communism. In Europe and elsewhere, the United States had protested any
attempts by its allies or by neutrals to recognize the People's Republic
of China. And now the US president appeared, smiling and saluting, in
Beijing with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. The Japanese prime minister,
Sato Eisaku, who had been informed just a few minutes before Nixon's TV
speech in 1971, had been in tears. "I have done everything they [the
Americans] have asked," Sato said, but "they have let me
down."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en399en">^22^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en399}</p>
<p>For Japan, the "Niksonu Shokku," or Nixon Shocks, of 1971 led to some
big discussions about the country's future, even within the ruling LDP.
This was Japan's Cold War turning point. Nixon's departure from Bretton
Woods was to a high extent directed against Japan's commercial
interests. Seen from Washington, Japan had done too well under American
tutelage. And Nixon's China adventure had left Japan high and dry
diplomatically. Meanwhile Japan's domestic Cold War, between the LDP on
the one side and the Communists, Socialists, and trade unions on the
other, had abated (though much still divided them). The hapless Sato was
in 1972 replaced by Tanaka Kakuei, who immediately set out for Beijing
himself to make up for lost time. China and Japan agreed to establish
full diplomatic relations, recognize Taiwan as a part of the PRC, and
jointly oppose "hegemony" (shorthand for the Soviet Union) in the
region.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-413}Other Asians followed suit. Now encouraged
by Beijing, the North Vietnamese decided that Nixon was serious about
wanting out, and agreed to a peace deal with the Americans in Paris in
January 1973. The Paris Accords were a curious mix of points inserted
unilaterally by Washington and Hanoi, affirming both the unity of
Vietnam and the sovereignty of South Vietnam. "The military demarcation
line between the two zones at the 17th parallel is only provisional and
not a political or territorial boundary," the text said. But it also
said that "the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination is
sacred, inalienable, and shall be respected by all countries."
Understandably, Nixon had to twist the South Vietnamese leaders' arms to
get them to sign such a jerry-built agreement. In Beijing, Mao told the
North Vietnamese that they should take a break for at least six months
before they went on to conquer the whole country. But the
Sino-Vietnamese relationship was already in free fall. As Vietnam neared
forcible reunification under its Communists, Beijing suspected that
their long-time allies had now teamed up with the Soviets to control all
of Indochina.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon's opening to China had manifestly paid off in terms of
what mattered most to the president. Suddenly fearful of losing out on
the opportunity for détente with its main enemy, Leonid Brezhnev had
pushed the arms limitation talks with the Americans toward agreement.
When Nixon arrived in Moscow in May 1972, three months after his visit
to Beijing, a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) was ready for
signing. For Brezhnev the summit was the highlight of his career as a
statesman. Not only did the SALT agreement assume that the Soviet Union
had reached parity with the United States in terms of strategic nuclear
forces and was therefore militarily its equal, but the US president was
willing to accept a general text, which included some of the key
concepts that the Soviets had put forward in international relations
over the past twenty years. "In the nuclear age," said the Basic
Principles agreement signed in Moscow,</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-414}there is no alternative to conducting
[US-Soviet] mutual relations on the basis of peaceful coexistence.

:::</p>
<p>It was a remarkable declaration of a Cold War truce and of US
recognition of the Soviet Union as an equal. For a country that
throughout its twentieth-century history had built its foreign policy on
concepts of uniqueness and, eventually, unrivaled power, this was a big
step and, over time, a highly contested one domestically. But
internationally it set off a moment during the Cold War where people in
many different parts of the world for the first time thought that the
conflict would be resolved by negotiation and mutual convergence. At
this particular juncture it probably mattered less that neither Nixon
nor Kissinger thought so. Their worlds remained ensconced within the
Cold War. Elsewhere their actions helped some people start thinking
beyond it.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-415}One such departure in the 1970s stressed
human and governmental interdependence across Cold War blocs. Humanity
faced many challenges that were common to East and West alike, went the
argument from some intellectuals and politicians. States were getting
increasingly difficult to govern because they were getting more complex.
Information flows were more difficult to harness, both for public and
private activity, because there were more of them. Challenges of
education, health, social care, urban planning, and transport were
similar in all industrialized societies. Was it then not likely that
East and West would become more similar over time, and that ideologies
would matter less? The US economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who had
served in the Kennedy Administration, had foreseen this already in his
Reith Lectures for the BBC in 1966:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
The convergence between the two ostensibly different industrial systems,
the one billed as socialism and that derived from capitalism, is a fact.
And we must also assume that it is a good thing. In time, and perhaps in
less time than may be imagined, it will dispose of the notion of
inevitable conflict based on irreconcilable difference.... In the United
States, were it not so celebrated in ideology, it would long since have
been agreed that the line that now divides public from so-called private
organization in military procurement, space exploration, and atomic
energy is so indistinct as to be nearly
imperceptible.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en401en">^24^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en401}
:::</p>
<p>Common perceptions of the centrality of science and technology would be
key in bringing states of different persuasions closer together,
Galbraith and others argued. But the arms race stood in the way of
scientific cooperation. Distrust precluded common gains. Even though
Nixon and Brezhnev moved toward arms control, many experts felt that
such efforts were not moving fast enough. The Pugwash Conferences, in
which scientists from East and West met without (at least visible)
government interference, served to spread the idea that the scientific
elite had a particular responsibility for world peace. In its 1969
report, the conference maintained that "effective deterrence can be
obtained with a drastically reduced level of nuclear stockpiles.... The
enormity of the destruction that would result from a full scale nuclear
war with present stockpiles of nuclear weapons is simply not
comprehended by the general public. Scientists have a great
responsibility to help educate the public about
this."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en402en">^25^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en402}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-416}The Pugwash scientists were undoubtedly
right that US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles had reached unconscionable
levels by the 1970s. The SALT negotiations, important as they were in
building trust between the two sides, did nothing to reduce these
levels. Their aspiration was simply to reduce future growth in the
arsenals. During the 1960s the number of nuclear warheads had increased
massively. Most of this increase was in the Soviet Union and the United
States. The other nuclear powers---Britain, France, and China---had much
smaller arsenals. The Soviets attempted to catch up with the US lead. In
1964 the United States had had ten times as many strategic nuclear
warheads as the Soviet Union. Ten years later this advantage was
reduced, though the Americans still had more than three times as many
warheads, with much greater precision and deliverability. Between them,
though, the increase was staggering, as the overall number of nuclear
weapons had more than doubled during the 1960s. By 1975 there were
nearly fifty thousand nuclear weapons. Some of these had six to ten
independently targetable warheads. Their combined explosive power was
more than enough to destroy all of the Earth's combined landmass.</p>
<p>But the perverted logic of the arms race did not stop with Earth. After
the Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in 1957, the Cold War
also threatened to spread into space. The rockets used to lift
satellites into position was nearly identical to those propelling the
Superpowers' intercontinental nuclear missiles. Both sides knew that
making military use of such satellites would dramatically improve their
position in the arms race. Very soon they were used not only for
communications and missile guidance systems, but also for surveillance.
Some experts on both sides argued for putting offensive weapons in
space. Luckily, political leaders held back. One of the first signs of a
coming era of détente was a UN-sponsored treaty in 1967 prohibiting the
permanent stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-417}After the US moon landings in 1969 Nixon
and Brezhnev realized that some cooperation on space exploration might
be in the interest of both countries, and could provide a powerful
symbol of a new era in Superpower relations. Pushed by scientists from
both sides, the two leaders signed an agreement on cooperation in space
research during Nixon's 1972 visit to Moscow. "That's got so much
imagination to it," Kissinger crowed to his boss. "Kennedy," said Nixon,
being Nixon, "Kennedy could never get even that, that space thing."
Three years later space cooperation delivered one of the most striking
images of détente, when a US Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet
Soiuz and the astronauts shook hands through the opening hatch.</p>
<p>While some Cold War skeptics devoted themselves to promoting contact
between societies, scientific exchange, or disarmament, others protested
the Cold War as an extension of state control of the individual. The
youth protest of the 1960s went through a transformation in the 1970s,
at least for some of its protagonists. Out went the belief in Trotskyist
or Maoist alternatives, at least for the Western world. In came a
concern with state surveillance and state crimes. The French philosopher
André Glucksmann, who had been chanting Maoist slogans in the streets in
1968, six years later wrote a book in which he compared Stalin's crimes
to those of Hitler. Entitled <em>The Stove and the Cannibal: An Essay on
the Connections Between the State, Marxism, and the Concentration
Camps</em>, the book argued that Marxism in any form led to totalitarianism.
In the United States, too, former socialists---like Georgetown professor
Jean Kirkpatrick, and radicals like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of the
architects of Johnson's War on Poverty---began stressing individual
rights and choices over welfare provisions.</p>
<p>Some of the reinvigorated preoccupation with personal liberties in the
West linked up with the critique of Stalinist society coming from
Soviets and east Europeans. The Soviet Nobel laureate Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn stood out as one of the bravest investigators of his
government's crimes. His novel <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</em>
revealed the inhumane conditions in Soviet labor camps, in which
millions had served for no reason whatsoever. To Solzhenitsyn, the camp
guards' cry became emblematic for the Soviet Union itself: "Attention,
prisoners. Marching orders must be strictly obeyed. Keep to your ranks.
No hurrying, keep a steady pace. No talking. Keep your eyes fixed ahead
and your hands behind your backs. A step to right or left is considered
an attempt to escape and the escort has orders to shoot without
warning."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en403en">^26^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en403}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-418}Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet
Union in 1974. Other writers followed suit. Andrei Amalrik was forced to
go abroad two years later. His crime was that in an essay published in
the West he had asked whether the Soviet Union could survive until
George Orwell's infamous year 1984. A state so dependent on control and
repression would sooner or later get into trouble, Amalrik argued. The
longer authoritarianism and international isolation lasted, "the more
rapid and decisive will be the collapse when confrontation with reality
becomes inevitable." Against those both inside and outside the Soviet
Union who said that "the situation is better now than it was ten years
ago; therefore ten years from now it will be better still," Amalrik felt
instead that the Russian Revolution had run its course, and that it had
nothing more to offer the Soviet
peoples.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en404en">^27^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en404}</p>
<p>Other Cold War critics took their argument to the global level. They
argued that neither socialism nor capitalism had been able to solve the
big, common problems that humanity faced, and that the ideological
competition rather distracted from their resolution. The damage to the
environment caused by both forms of industrial development, the rapid
increase in population, which many experts assumed contributed to hunger
and turmoil, and the dire poverty in the postcolonial states convinced
many in the West that the Cold War would soon be a thing of the past.
The 1967--69 civil war in Nigeria, which was set off by resource
competition and ethnic conflict rather than Superpower intervention,
seemed more real than any potential clashes across the Cold War divide
in Europe. The pictures of starving children in Biafra, broadcast
worldwide by both East and West, seemed more of a threat to a common
future than the arcane menace of a nuclear Armageddon.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-419}But even for those who foresaw other
threats as gaining in importance, détente between East and West stood
out as a positive step. In the United States in 1973 almost 70 percent
of the population believed that the United States and the USSR could
work together for peace. There were even higher levels of support for
SALT and for increased contacts in other fields, including trade and
technological
cooperation.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en405en">^28^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en405} In
western Europe opinion polls showed that many people thought the Cold
War was over for good. Less than 10 percent of West Germans thought that
the Soviet Union was a real threat to their country. Interestingly, when
asked who they thought would be most powerful in fifty years' time, more
than twice as many West Germans said the Soviet Union than said the
United States.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en406en">^29^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en406}
But unlike in the 1950s, this prospect seemed no longer to fill them
with horror.</p>
<p>At first, at least, even the increasingly visible foibles of détente's
main protagonists in the West, President Nixon and West German
chancellor Brandt, did not disturb public support for détente. Nixon's
trouble with the law engulfed his presidency soon after his reelection
in 1972. The president was found to have interfered with the
investigation of a break-in at the headquarters of his Democratic
opponents at the Watergate building in Washington. The burglary had been
carried out on the orders of White House officials, and pressure on
Nixon to testify increased. When it became clear that he faced
impeachment and probable removal from office, Nixon resigned in August
1974. He was the first US president to resign and did so in disgrace.</p>
<p>Willy Brandt's chancellorship also ran aground on trouble of his own
making. Like Nixon, he had been reelected in the autumn of 1972 with a
solid public mandate. Brandt seemed uncertain, though, over where to
move his <em>Ostpolitik</em> initiatives next. He did not want to challenge the
US concept of a Superpower-led détente too directly, and he hoped to see
more positive changes in the East, and especially in East Germany,
before presenting new plans for East-West cooperation. Meanwhile,
Brandt's private life was increasingly messy. He drank too much and his
extramarital affairs worried his colleagues, even before they found out
that a key official in Brandt's office was an East German spy. Fearful
of attempts at blackmail, Brandt resigned in May 1974. His replacement,
Helmut Schmidt, supported Ostpolitik but was a marked skeptic over any
eastern European and Soviet long-term willingness to reciprocate for
Western concessions.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-420}Nixon's successor in the White House,
Gerald Ford, was also a strong supporter of further engagement with the
Soviets and the Chinese. Henry Kissinger continued as foreign policy
supremo, now as secretary of state, even though his position within the
new Administration was gradually more curtailed. With Congress
controlled by the Democrats and even many Republicans after Watergate
critical of the strong executive Nixon had tried to put in place, the
White House's room for maneuver in foreign policy became limited. In
spite of this, the Ford Administration was able to complete the
framework for a new SALT agreement, SALT II, which set equal and clear
limits to the number of strategic nuclear weapons each side could
possess, even in case of multiple warheads for each missile (MIRVs). The
agreement also attempted to prevent the future deployment of new types
of strategic weapons.</p>
<p>In November 1974 President Ford traveled to Vladivostok on the Soviet
Pacific coast to sign the framework agreement for SALT II. In the
negotiations there, both leaders attempted to move ahead as quickly as
possible, sometimes against the advice of their own military experts.
Brezhnev claimed that his aim was to settle the arms race so that the
Soviet Union could turn more to domestic development. "We are spending
billions on all these things, billions that would be much better spent
for the benefit of the people," Brezhnev told
Ford.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en407en">^30^</a>{#chapter015.xhtml#en407} But the
Soviet leader also wanted full equality in terms of all kinds of
strategic weapons, including those where the Soviets in reality were
lagging behind the United States. Full strategic parity therefore became
a kind of trap for Brezhnev, if his aim was to salvage more funds for
civilian purposes. The Soviet Union had to spend increasing amounts to
reach the levels of weaponry they had falsely claimed, and the Americans
generally believed, that the Red Army was already at.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter015.xhtml#page-421}By the mid-1970s proponents of détente had
achieved much in ways that could not have been foreseen a decade
earlier. It is too easy to say, as some do, that the time was ripe for
such measures of confidence-building. Even though the détente process
was haphazard and, on some critical issues, contradictory, it had taken
real courage to bring it to where it was by 1975. The aging Brezhnev had
made it into his life's work and believed it would preserve peace, even
as he and his colleagues in Marxist terms began suspecting that global
capitalism had entered a structural crisis that advantaged the Soviet
Union in international affairs. The Chinese leaders also deserve some
approbation for breaking with the past, even though they wanted to use
the security they had gained for further nefarious purposes at home. It
was, however, Richard Nixon who had made it all possible. Because he
fundamentally distrusted his own people, Nixon had forced US foreign
policy onto a track where, for the first time during the Cold War, it
dealt with others on the assumption that US global hegemony would not
last forever.

<p>Different from what Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's national security
adviser, often claimed, it was not China that was the global Cold War
wild card. China under Mao was too ideological, too inward-looking, to
serve that role. If there were a Cold War wild card it was India, a
democracy of then more than four hundred million people, which had got
its independence from Britain in 1947 and had largely adopted a
British-style system of government. The new Indian leadership, under
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his Congress Party, defined itself
as nonaligned, anticolonial, and socialist. While inspired to a
significant degree by Soviet ideas of centralized planning, Nehru was
fiercely opposed to the concept of power blocs. The Cold War, as an
international system, repelled him. In Nehru's view, it was in its
essence based on European preoccupations and drew attention away from
the real problems the majority of the world's population faced:
underdevelopment, hunger, and colonial oppression.</p>
<p>For the patrician Nehru, socialism was first and foremost about social
assistance and equality in the broadest sense. Much inspired by British
Left-wing traditions during his education at Harrow and Cambridge, the
first Indian prime minister saw himself as "temperamentally and by
training an individualist and intellectually a socialist.... I hope that
socialism does not kill or suppress individuality. Indeed, I am
attracted to it because it will release innumerable individuals from
economic and cultural
bondage."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en408en">^1^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en408} In the
Congress Party resolution on economic policy, passed the year before the
Second Five Year Plan started in 1956, "the national aim is a welfare
state and a socialist economy. This can only be achieved by a
considerable increase in income and much greater volume of goods and
services and employment. Economic policy must, therefore, aim at plenty
and at equitable
distribution."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en409en">^2^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en409}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-424}To get the kind of development Nehru and
the Congress leadership was looking for, Third World solidarity,
national sovereignty, and freedom of action was essential. New India
therefore in many ways defined itself in opposition to the Cold War,
domestically and internationally. It was a key convener in assembling
the Bandung Conference of 1955, and it became a founding member of the
Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. In its foreign policy, it emphasized the
role of inclusive international institutions, especially the UN. Well
before European or Superpower détente set in, Nehru believed that the
Cold War as an international system was detrimental to India's interests
and those values he felt his country represented. Foreign leaders
sometimes tired of Nehru's moralistic lectures and his insistence on
India as an example. But his country was a power to be reckoned with,
both in its Asian setting and through Nehru's insistence on India as a
Cold War antidote.</p>
<p><strong>W[HILE SETTING UP]{.small-caps}</strong> India as an example for others
seemed relatively easy, given the chaos that reigned in many parts of
the postcolonial world, forging policies that would further Nehru's aims
at home and abroad was more difficult. Under Nehru, Congress remained
wedded to the British-style institutions that the country had adopted,
including one person / one vote elections at least every fifth year.
Some Indians argued that in a country with more than 80 percent
illiteracy such a system was administratively ineffective and
politically meaningless. The Indian Communist Party castigated Nehru for
not doing enough to uproot entrenched social oppression in the
countryside, especially through the caste system, or to curb
exploitation of workers in the cities. The Communists built substantial
support in many Indian states, such as Kerala and West Bengal, and was
the largest opposition party in parliament. But they were always
vulnerable to Nehru's attacks on them for supporting violence,
disregarding Indian national interests, and oppressing individual
freedoms. In the late 1950s, after the Communists won the elections in
Kerala, Nehru intervened to have them unceremoniously booted out of
office by the central government. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, who had
been made president of the Congress Party with which the local
Communists had been feuding, tolerated no resistance: "When Kerala is
virtually on fire, it becomes the Center's duty to go to the aid of the
people; the misrule of the Communist rulers of the state has created a
situation which... does not brook legal
quibbling."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en410en">^3^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en410}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-425}Brooking no resistance at home---from
Communists, recalcitrant landowners and aristocrats, or from ethnic
minority groups---Congress's main foreign challenge was fighting the
consequences of the 1947 partition of India. Nehru claimed to have
accepted the creation of Pakistan as an independent state, and indeed he
did prefer it, as any sensible person would, over the continuation of
the ethnic slaughter India had descended to during the year of
independence. But the existence of a religious state, carved out of
Indian territory both to the west and the east, vexed him as a radical
secularist. He confessed privately that it would have been better if
Pakistan had not existed. But, since it did exist, he insisted on
treating it as an equal. What made such an approach difficult was the
ongoing fighting in the state of Kashmir, located between India and
Pakistan in the northwest. In 1947 Kashmir had acceded to India, but
parts of its Muslim majority clamored for inclusion into Pakistan or
independence. After a brief war, India controlled two-thirds of Kashmir,
and Pakistan the remainder. For Pakistani leaders, fighting Indian
control of Kashmir was a matter of national liberation. For Nehru, it
was a matter of India's territorial integrity and its status as a
noncommunal, multi-ethnic state. Nehru's own ancestors hailed from
Kashmir. Though India offered a plebiscite to settle the matter, there
was no way the prime minister, or his country, would give up Kashmir to
Pakistani pressure.</p>
<p>On the world stage, Nehru stressed India's nonaligned foreign policy and
the need for global solutions to world problems, preferably through the
UN. His visit to the United States, during which he famously did not hit
it off with his host, President Truman, was intended to socialize the
Americans into the expanding community of nations. "Two tragic wars have
demonstrated the futility of warfare," Nehru told the US Congress.
"Victory without the will to peace achieves no lasting result.... May I
venture to say that this is not an incorrect description of the world
today? It is not flattering either to man's reason or to our common
humanity. Must this unhappy state persist and the power of science and
wealth continue to be harnessed to the service of destruction?... The
greater a nation, the greater is its responsibility to find and to work
for the right
answer."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en411en">^4^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en411}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-426}India refused to come in on the US side in
the Cold War, as Truman had hoped and almost expected. Bilateral US
economic assistance continued. But "they expected something more than
gratitude and goodwill," Nehru said on returning home, "and that more I
could not supply
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en412en">^5^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en412}</p>
<p>The Americans did indeed hope for more. Truman and his secretary of
state, Dean Acheson, found it very difficult to accept that nonalignment
in the Indian case meant just that: an insistence on an independent
foreign policy and a refusal to become subservient to either power bloc.
On Korea, for instance, Nehru condemned the North Korean attack, but
immediately began searching for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Written off in Washington as hopelessly naive, the Indian initiatives
did have an effect, especially on the cease-fire and prisoner of war
negotiations at the end of the war. But Nehru's efforts to end the war
did not leave much of an impression on Truman. "Nehru has sold us down
the Hudson," the president reportedly complained in late 1950. "His
attitude has been responsible for us losing the war in
Korea."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en413en">^6^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en413}</p>
<p>While Nehru kept his distance from the Americans, Pakistani leaders were
happy to embrace them. Economically hobbled at home and feeling under
pressure by India, the Muslim elite that had created the Pakistani state
rushed to link up with US Cold War efforts. Pakistani envoys presented
their country as a key link in the Cold War chain around the Soviet
Union, especially since India had refused to contribute to the
anti-Communist cause. Without US aid, they claimed, Pakistan could
easily become a target for Soviet expansionism and the Soviet search for
warm-water ports. In 1954 the Eisenhower Administration rewarded them
with a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement, under which Pakistan
received substantial US military aid. Pakistan also joined the South
East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Baghdad Pact, which
promised support from the United States and Britain in case of an attack
on its territory. The other Asian members of these pacts were the
Philippines, Thailand, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Nehru was livid. When
receiving Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, in New
Delhi in 1956, the Indian prime minister castigated US policy. "He said
he recognized that NATO might have been born of a real necessity,"
Dulles reported, but</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-427}he doubted the genuine security value of
any of the Asian arrangements. He bitterly deplored SEATO and Baghdad,
which he felt Pakistan had entered not for security against the Soviet
Communists but in order to get strength to use against India. He felt
that the Pakistanis were a martial people and a fanatical people who
could readily attack India.... He deplored the fact that United States
armament of Pakistan was leading India to arm and to make large
expenditures for defense when it wanted to concentrate its efforts on
improving its economic and social condition. (In this discussion of
Pakistan with which he dealt at length, he showed signs of strong
emotion.)<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en414en">^7^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en414}
:::</p>
<p>Much of Nehru's foreign policy was designed to break out of the south
Asian strictures posed by partition. With some right, he blamed
colonialism for south Asia's ills. It was the British, Nehru thought,
who had set Muslims against Hindus, and who had set up independent
states on the periphery of the subcontinent: Burma, Ceylon, Nepal,
Bhutan, and Sikkim. They had accepted Goa as a Portuguese colony on the
Indian west coast. They had given power to an assortment of territories
ruled by princes and maharajas, whom the prime minister now had to
tempt, cajole, and threaten into becoming full members of the Indian
state. Anticolonial and Asian solidarity was therefore important to
Nehru, first and foremost among the major Asian states. In his first
years in power he reached out to Indonesia, which he saw as an
equivalent to India in southeast Asia. He also wanted to work closely
with China, in part in order to convince the Chinese Communists that
they were Asians first and foremost. And he opposed the US Security
Treaty with Japan, which he saw as a Cold War arrangement imposed on an
Asian nation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-428}At Bandung in 1955, some participants came
to view the conference as a bit too much of an Indian show, given
Nehru's superstar status. His message to the conference was clear,
though. The Cold War was against the interests of the Third World.
Threatening the world with nuclear annihilation was not only immoral but
it deflected from the real problems the postcolonial countries faced:
poverty, illiteracy, epidemic illness, and social dislocation created by
colonialism. The new postcolonial states had to work together to
overcome both the ills left over from the colonial era and current Cold
War threats. And the only way to get such cooperation going was for
other countries to learn from India's nonalignment and its willingness
to stand up for Third World principles even if the Cold War Superpowers
told it not to. Somewhat sanctimoniously, Nehru told the leaders
assembled at Bandung that on some issues they would have to give up
their own national interests to support what was morally right and good
for the common cause.</p>
<p>Nehru's key preoccupation in the follow-up from Bandung was to extend
what he called practical solidarity to causes of decolonization,
national unity, and opposition to foreign domination. At the UN, India
lambasted the tardiness of European countries in setting African
countries free. It spoke out against the increasing US role in
Indochina, and welcomed the revolutions in Egypt and in Cuba. But unlike
more radical Third World countries, Nehru continued to believe that
cooperation with Europeans was possible, and that violent conflict
should be avoided. Radicals such as Nasser were disappointed with
India's position in favor of negotiations during the Suez Crisis or its
lack of military support for African liberation movements. Nasser, Ben
Bella, and Nelson Mandela deplored India's emphasis on mediation and
arbitration, and its continued willingness to remain within the British
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-429}Within India itself, however, Nehru was
moving further to the Left in his attempts to further his country's
rapid development. Since the 1930s, the Congress leadership had been
fascinated with Soviet planning models and the success these plans
seemed to have in modernizing a backward country. After independence,
Indian economists trained in Britain and influenced by Left-wing Labour
ideas of state-centered development began putting together large-scale
plans for how India could change into an industrial power while feeding
its increasing population. But in spite of their British background, the
Five Year Plans the Indian experts drew up were more GosPlan than LSE,
more Lenin than Laski. The concrete and proven example of the Soviet
experiment weighed heavier than vague and contested British schemes. In
the Second Five Year Plan, from 1956, Nehru's chief planner, Prasanta
Chandra Mahalanobis, outlined the aims of the enterprise:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
It must provide for a larger increase in production, in investment and
in employment. Simultaneously, it must accelerate the institutional
changes needed to make the economy more dynamic and more progressive in
terms no less of social than of economic ends. Development is a
continuous process; it touches all aspects of community life and has to
be viewed comprehensively. Economic planning thus extends itself into
extra-economic spheres, educational, social and cultural. Each plan for
a limited period becomes the starting point for more sustained effort
covering longer periods, and each step in advance opens out new vistas
and brings into view new problems to be
solved.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en415en">^8^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en415}
:::</p>
<p>The launch of the Second Five Year Plan coincided not only with India's
championing of South-South solidarity, as at Bandung, but also with a
substantial boosting of ties between India and the Soviet Bloc.
Khrushchev visited India in 1955 and in spite of finding Nehru almost as
difficult to deal with at the personal level as the Americans did, the
Soviet leader was quick to declare a new era of Soviet-Indian
friendship. Soviet aid began coming to India, although it for many years
paled in comparison with development aid from North America and western
Europe.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en416en">^9^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en416} But
Khrushchev went further than just money, technology, and experts. He
also unequivocally supported the Indian position on international issues
such as Kashmir. Somewhat cynically, the Indian embassy in Moscow told
Nehru that "the Soviets are afraid that their eastern partner, China,
with her enormous man-power and growing industrial strength might prove
to be an uncomfortable friend. To cope with such a contingency when and
if it arises, they want to establish counterbalancing conditions.... Who
else could do it better than
India?..."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en417en">^10^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en417}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-430}China had been a conundrum for Nehru ever
since he became Indian prime minister. During the Chinese civil war,
Nehru's sympathy had mainly been with the Communists because of their
rural roots and their program for social justice. But first and foremost
he deplored the violence of the war and the doctrinaire Marxist approach
the CCP showed after its victory. In Nehru's mind the two were
connected. War fostered extreme radicalism and aggression. He wanted to
build closer relations with China as a fellow Asian country, but he was
cautious because of the new Beijing regime's willingness to use terror
to solve domestic problems and because of its ideological alliance with
the Soviet Union. Even so, Nehru made it clear that China needed to be
included in the Afro-Asian group of countries that he hoped to build. "I
have no doubt at all," he told his colleagues, "that the Government and
people of China desire
peace."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en418en">^11^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en418}</p>
<p>The status of Tibet, an autonomous borderland that China claimed as part
of its sovereign territory, was a key problem in the Sino-Indian
relationship. The Chinese Communist leaders feared that independent
India was continuing British attempts at influencing Tibet for its
purposes. Nehru, however, had no problems accepting China's sovereignty
over the region, although he sympathized with the young Dalai Lama's
attempts at keeping as much self-government as possible. The Indian
prime minister was also keen that Tibet kept religious freedom for its
largely Buddhist population. The Indian consulate in Lhasa, which served
as a listening post for matters going on in Tibet, reported on the
backwardness of the country and its need for development from "a
curiously preserved antiquated feudal system more cruel than
benign."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en419en">^12^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en419} But it
also stressed Tibet's role as a giant buffer zone between China and
India.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-431}When Chinese Communist troops entered
Tibet in 1950, Nehru appealed for Chinese "forbearance and generosity"
toward the Tibetans, but also advised the Tibetans to attempt to work
with Beijing. To be on the safe side, he offered the Dalai Lama exile in
India if needed. But he also authorized military support for the Tibetan
government. "Supplies of arms and ammunition began to pour into Tibet by
April 1950," according to the Indian consulate in
Lhasa.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en420en">^13^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en420} India's
support did not help much, however, and by late 1950 much of Tibet was
under control of the People's Liberation Army. Nehru refused US offers
of joint support for the Tibetan resistance. Instead he advised the
Dalai Lama, who was camped close to the Indian border, to return to
Lhasa and agree to some of the Chinese demands in order to preserve as
much as possible of Tibetan
freedom.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en421en">^14^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en421}</p>
<p>Mao Zedong was furious over Indian behavior on Tibet. In conversations
with the Soviets, he referred to Nehru as a double-dealing imperialist
agent and the "running dog" of British and American interests. The fact
that Nehru had left the British diplomat and Tibetologist Hugh
Richardson in place as Indian consul in Lhasa proved their case, the CCP
leaders believed. While Beijing appreciated India's support in ending
the war in Korea, it took a long time for any real trust to develop
between the two sides.</p>
<p>In 1954, as part of China's contribution to the Soviet post-Stalin peace
offensive, Beijing agreed to talks with Delhi on the Tibet issue. Nehru,
who had been calling for such talks for a long time, was delighted with
the newfound Chinese approach. He knew, of course, that China had now
cemented its position in Tibet, and that Mao's sudden reasonableness was
in part connected with this. But the Indian prime minister was genuinely
surprised at how much the principles the Chinese put forward as general
concepts for Sino-Indian cooperation did fit with his own ideas.
Incorporated in the agreements were what Nehru began referring to, in
Sanskrit, as <em>Panch Sheel</em>, the five virtues, and the Chinese, after
consultation with the Soviets, as the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. They included the principles of "mutual respect for each
other's territorial integrity and sovereignty; mutual non-aggression;
mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and
mutual benefit; and peaceful
co-existence."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en422en">^15^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en422}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-432}At Bandung, Nehru highlighted the Panch
Sheel principles as a basic foreign policy for the Afro-Asian countries
and movements. In reality, of course, they were far less than a policy,
but also more, in terms of common propositions, than East and West had
been able to agree on during the Cold War. For the Indians, the Five
Principles were principally a way of tying China into an outer circle of
Third World cooperation. While truly independent and nonaligned
countries like India, Indonesia, Egypt, and Ghana were to be the core of
South-South networks, Nehru hoped that Asian states like China or Japan
would be able to participate in spite of their Cold War alliances. The
long-term aim, Nehru stated openly, was to break them away from their
orientation toward the Cold War and bring them fully into an Afro-Asian
partnership for global change.</p>
<p>India's foreign policy after Bandung aimed at building a closer
cooperation among countries in Asia and Africa on issues of
anticolonialism, disarmament, and development. Congress leaders invited
delegations from other new countries to visit India and to study its
experience in science, technology, planning, and education. At the UN,
Indian representatives pushed for international solutions to Cold War
conflicts, and supported liberation movements in southern Africa,
Algeria, and Indochina (where Delhi viewed the Vietnam conflict mainly
as an issue of decolonization and opposed US involvement). Indian
diplomats and activists also reported on US race issues. To most of
them, the American unwillingness to face up to racial oppression in
their own country was a sign of how little could be expected from
Washington on questions of international decolonization. Nehru firmly
believed that decolonization and human rights were linked in a global
context. Even so, he remained a skeptic toward using UN human rights
declarations as instruments of foreign policy because he believed that
in most cases state sovereignty trumped international agreements on
domestic matters. Nevertheless, Nehru found UN resolutions and
conventions to be of great use since they could be turned against racial
discrimination in South Africa or British colonial oppression in Kenya.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-433}The other main aspect of Indian foreign
policy was to build a broad bloc of nonaligned states in order to defeat
the Cold War. This project was linked to the Third World initiatives
coming out of Bandung, but it was still separate. Its intention was to
get countries of very different political orientations to break with the
Cold War dichotomy and declare themselves as nonaligned. This aim meant,
for instance, that there was no room for China or Japan, but that
Indonesia, Ghana, and Egypt played leading roles beside India. The big
addition was Yugoslavia, whose flamboyant leader, Tito, became a key
figure in the Non-Aligned Movement. His visit to India in 1954, during
which he lauded all of his hosts' concepts of foreign policy, made him a
hero in Delhi. Tito was, Indian diplomats observed, "the first great
European statesman who came to Asia not as a representative of
colonizers, but as a great friend of Asian
nations."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en423en">^16^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en423} In the
summer of 1956, discussions among Nehru, Nasser, and Tito on the
Yugoslav island of Brioni kicked off the idea of a more formal
cooperation among countries committed to nonaligned principles, not only
in Asia and Africa, but also in Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Since its expulsion from the Soviet bloc on Stalin's whim in 1948,
Yugoslavia had lived a precarious existence on the margins of Europe:
still Communist, but sustained by Western aid and defended by its own
substantial army. Tito wanted his country to be more than a heroic
outcast. He saw Yugoslavia as a beacon of independent socialist
development and as a model for new countries in the Third World that did
not want to subsume themselves in a Cold War dichotomy. It was possible
to be socialist, independent, and respected by both power blocs, Tito
claimed. After Khrushchev's 1955 admission that Stalin's accusations
against Tito had been pure fantasy, Yugoslavia's stock in the Third
World rose even higher.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-434}For India and other new countries,
Yugoslavia also played a major role as an arms exporter and supplier of
military advisers. Up to Tito's death in 1980, his country was the
militant wing of the Non-Aligned Movement, supplying equipment from its
own plentiful military industry, not only to independent Third World
countries, but also to liberation movements in Angola, Zimbabwe, and
Guinea. In some cases Yugoslav military supplies rivaled those of the
Soviet Union and provided a lifeline for countries that feared becoming
too dependent on Moscow for their defense needs. Nehru and his
successors regarded Tito as perhaps their closest ally. Nehru's
daughter, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, viewed the Yugoslav leader as a
mentor in international affairs, almost like a substitute father.</p>
<p>But India also believed that it could have a more direct influence on
the Soviet Union itself. Nehru never gave up hope on weaning the Soviets
away from their Cold War behavior. Moscow reacted aggressively because
it felt threatened, the Indian prime minister believed. "Whoever might
have been responsible for this 'cold war,' the effect on the Soviet
Union was to create apprehension and a continuing sense of danger," he
told his chief ministers in 1955. Nehru found that it was "probable that
if there is a marked improvement in world tensions and the cold war
ceases, then internal developments and changes will take place in these
East European
states."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en424en">^17^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en424} Indian
diplomats saw Khrushchev's break with Stalin's policies at the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union's Twentieth Congress in 1956 as a consequence
of India's benign influence. Soviet leaders visiting India "must have
been impressed at once by her progress and her abhorrence of violence.
The theory that violence was not a prerequisite for the transformation
of society was thus a recognition of a state of affairs which had come
into existence. The conversations of the Soviet leaders with our Prime
Minister and the intensive study of his books... must also have prompted
Soviet leaders to discount the role of violence in the march towards
socialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en425en">^18^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en425}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-435}The Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956
dented the Indian image of the Soviet Union, but did not destroy it.
India continued to receive Soviet aid for its development programs and
to build its military capacity. But Nehru became even more preoccupied
with the cause of nonalignment and the idea of building an anti--Cold
War bloc. His doubts about the more radical approaches of Nasser,
Nkrumah, or Sukarno did not lead to divergence. Rather, such doubts
reinforced India's need to be close to the other nonaligned nations, in
order to influence them. After all, Nehru concluded, what drove his
fellow Third World leaders toward unnecessary radicalism was the
unwillingness of the imperialist states to give up their positions and
privileges. The 1960--61 Congo crisis was a case in point. Nehru was
horrified at Lumumba's murder and placed the blame squarely on the
Belgians and their US partners. India committed five thousand troops to
UN peacekeeping operations in the country, on the condition that the
secretary-general guaranteed Congo's national integrity.</p>
<p>The Congo crisis was the prod that led nonaligned countries to meet in
Yugoslavia's capital, Belgrade, in 1961 to set up regular conferences
and arrangements, later known as the Non-Aligned Movement. While
strongly in favor of nonaligned cooperation, Nehru had been a skeptic
toward setting up a more integrated organization, in part because he
feared that it would reduce India's flexibility and independence in
foreign affairs. Concerns over Congo had proven him wrong, even to
himself. The non-bloc countries had to cooperate and take charge of the
process of decolonization. If not, the Superpowers would exploit it for
their own purposes. And the aborted Khrushchev-Eisenhower summit in
Paris in 1960 proved that the Superpowers were not able to manage their
own affairs, far less those of others. "War," said the final statement
from the Belgrade meeting, "has never threatened mankind with graver
consequences than today." But at the same time the participants stressed
that "imperialism is weakening. Colonial empires and other forms of
foreign oppression of peoples in Asia, Africa and Latin America are
gradually disappearing from the stage of
history."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en426en">^19^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en426}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-436}The fear of many of the founders of the
Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 was that the death throes of colonialism
could lead to new wars. While "a lasting peace can be achieved only
if... the domination of colonialism-imperialism and neo-colonialism in
all their manifestations is radically eliminated... the Conference
resolutely rejects the view that war, including the 'cold war,' is
inevitable, as this view reflects a sense both of helplessness and
hopelessness.... They affirm their unwavering faith that the
international community is able to organize its life without resorting
to means which actually belong to a past epoch of human
history."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en427en">^20^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en427} For
Nehru, the Belgrade declaration was both a design for a future without a
Cold War and a warning about how fragile global peace actually was.</p>
<p>The nascent Non-Aligned Movement consisted of some strange bedfellows.
While China had been excluded, Fidel Castro's Cubans made one of their
international debuts at Belgrade. Only a year later, during the Cuban
missile crisis, Castro would call on the Soviet Union to risk global
nuclear war in defense of Cuban independence. But a number of
conservative monarchies were also represented: Ethiopia, Morocco, and
Saudi Arabia. Belgrade was not only different from Bandung because
European and Latin American countries were represented; it was also
different because the conference was more about the right to
independence, sovereignty, and peace than about Third World solidarity.
The state, in its various forms, played a more central place at Belgrade
than it had done at Bandung. This was not surprising, perhaps, because
of the sheer number of new states that had come into existence between
1955 and 1961. But, together with the Group of 77, it signaled a future
in which states and their demands would rub up against a more radical
reorganization of international affairs as envisaged in the early phase
of decolonization.</p>
<p>For India, the need for security for its young state would become
glaringly visible only a year after the founding of the Non-Aligned
Movement. The 1962 war with China destroyed much of the optimism that
Nehru's young assistants, though not always the prime minister himself,
had shown about the future. Nehru was less concerned about the charges
of naiveté leveled against him inside and outside of India than the
effects the war would have on his country's international aspirations.
As the Chinese armies advanced, Nehru despaired to the point of asking
for a Soviet and then a US intervention. While the Soviets hedged their
bets, not least because of the need for Chinese support in the
concurrent Cuban crisis, the Kennedy Administration responded with
airdrops of weapons for the Indian army. The president wanted to use
India's urgent needs as a way of improving relations with Delhi. "By the
Chinese action," Kennedy said, "the subcontinent has become a new area
of major confrontation between the Free World and the Communists.... The
Indians themselves are at long last fully aware of the Chinese Communist
threat and appear to be determined to meet
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en428en">^21^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en428}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-437}In spite of his government's considerable
responsibility for its outbreak, it is true to say that the war broke
Nehru's heart. He had hoped to be a peace-maker between East and West.
And he had hoped that India, in its domestic as well as its foreign
policy, would be an example of self-sufficiency and nonalignment for
others to follow. Instead he was reduced to pleading for aid from the
Superpowers to stem the military advance of another Asian country. "It
is a tragedy," he noted, "that we who have stood for peace everywhere,
should be attacked in this way and be compelled to resist attack by
arms."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en429en">^22^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en429} After the
cease-fire, Nehru felt that his Asian policy was in tatters. Neither he
nor his successors gave up on India's policy of nonalignment. But
especially after Nehru's death in 1964 this policy was inoculated with a
solid portion of Indian nationalism, particularly with regard to its own
region.</p>
<p>Pakistan's response to the US military aid to India during the China
crisis was to further build its own relations with Beijing. This was
perhaps the Cold War's most unlikely romance. The Pakistani officers who
engineered the alliance were conservative Muslims who had no interest in
China's Communist excesses. And the Chinese accepted the Pakistani
embrace simply on the principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend. When
Washington, still Pakistan's main ally, demurred, the Pakistani military
dictator, General Mohammed Ayub Khan, increased pressure on India in
Kashmir. He wanted to show Pakistan's military prowess to the Chinese
and demonstrate to US president Johnson that his country was not
dependent on American aid. Outwardly, the 1965 Pakistani incursion into
Indian-controlled Kashmir was presented as a Kashmiri people's
rebellion. But the Indian government knew better.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-438}Nehru's successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, an
otherwise unassuming man, decided to strike back. He ordered large-scale
attacks against Pakistani forces not just in Kashmir, but in western and
eastern Pakistan simultaneously. With its forces defeated on the
battlefield, Ayub Khan's regime was in trouble. The Americans refused to
help, and the Chinese did not have the capacity. The Pakistanis'
unlikely appeals to the Soviets for assistance just showed what dire
straits they were in militarily. Ayub's desperation over his own folly
did, however, give Moscow a rare Cold War opportunity to play the
peace-maker. The terms for the cease-fire were negotiated under its
auspices in the Soviet central Asian city of Tashkent. In territorial
terms, the result was close to status quo. But Pakistan's weaknesses had
been exposed, as had India's ability and intentions to be the
predominant power within its region.</p>
<p>Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, was chosen as prime minister after
Shastri's sudden death, from a heart attack, during the Tashkent
negotiations. India's new leader was a far tougher policy-maker than
either of her predecessors. She was committed to a secular, socialist
India that controlled its region and sought global influence through the
UN and the Non-Aligned Movement in light of what she saw as its national
interests. Even more than her father, she was profoundly skeptical about
the US role in the world and viewed the Soviets as easier to work with,
especially in light of the ongoing US alliance with Pakistan and
Pakistan's flirtation with China. Gandhi's main security concern was
Beijing, and the intensification of the Sino-Soviet conflict in the late
1960s alerted her to how much the Soviets and the Indians had in common
strategically, even though she did not share Moscow's Communist
ideology.</p>
<p>China's drift toward further radicalism and the Cultural Revolution
frightened the Indian leaders, as it did many others. It convinced them
that India would be even more of a target for Beijing than it had been
in the past. Although they noted that China's self-inflicted damage
"does not cause us any pain," they reacted sharply against harassment of
Indians living in China, including the sacking of a Sikh temple in
Shanghai and attacks on the Indian embassy in Beijing. Indira Gandhi
made it clear that Indian policy toward China, including giving asylum
to the Dalai Lama, would not change unless China stopped encouraging
Pakistan to act aggressively and fomenting Communist rebellions within
India itself. "India," noted the Ministry for External Affairs in Delhi,
"is still the only sector in which the Chinese can indulge in military
adventurism and hope to get away with
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en430en">^23^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en430}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-439}The Non-Aligned Movement became Gandhi's
favored foreign policy arena. As the movement expanded, she increasingly
took a central place in it. The movement, she said, "means equality
among nations, and the democratization of international relations,
economic and political. It wants global cooperation for development on
the basis of mutual benefit. It is a strategy for the recognition and
preservation of the world's
diversity."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en431en">^24^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en431} But
Gandhi was far too realistic to put all her eggs in one basket with
regard to security and international affairs. Her Non-Aligned Movement
strategy paralleled, but did not impede, increased cooperation with the
Soviet Union on technology and defense. Gandhi made sure to keep her
independence also vis-à-vis Moscow. She sharply criticized the Soviet
occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968. She also attacked any Soviet
attempt to increase its influence in Pakistan, for instance through
small-scale weapons sales to the regime in Islamabad. Even a "symbolic
supply could be dangerous," the Indian foreign secretary admonished
visiting Soviet leaders in 1969. "The prospect of Soviet tanks fighting
Soviet tanks could not be welcome in the Soviet
Union."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en432en">^25^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en432} The
United States remained a key supplier of civilian aid to India. This
vital assistance came from the US government, from US contributions to
multilateral organizations, and from private foundations. But US aid to
India and its help during the war with China did little to improve the
overall political relationship. India's criticism of US Asian policies
grated many American leaders and made them regard the Indians as
ungrateful. US attempts to get more sympathy from Delhi on its
intervention in Indochina in the wake of the China war made no progress.
When US vice president Hubert Humphrey was sent to India to solicit
Indira Gandhi's support, "she confined herself to expressing concern at
the likely escalation of the conflict in Vietnam and the need for a
peaceful
solution."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en433en">^26^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en433} The
US unwillingness to sacrifice its alliance with Pakistan also got in the
way of a closer US-India relationship. And Indians commented sharply on
what they saw as a lack of racial justice in the United States and the
lack of a US commitment to racial equality worldwide. The United States,
said a 1969 overview of US internal changes by Indian diplomats, "has
reached a stage, where a dangerous relationship exists between... black
rage and white fear. The confrontationist tactics of the one evoke a
reactionary response in the other." It was this response, Gandhi
believed, that had produced Richard Nixon's election victory in
1968.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en434en">^27^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en434}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-440}But Indira Gandhi's main challenge as she
fastened her grip on Congress and Indian politics was not the
relationship with the United States. It was domestic development in
India. First and foremost she felt the need to make more progress in
battling her country's chronic problems with poverty and hunger. India
had avoided China's development disasters, but also it had made much
less progress in promoting health and education. A country priding
itself on its democratic development was still dependent on food aid
from abroad. Gandhi was convinced that the Indian development model
would pay off if the political conditions were right. But in India, as
in Pakistan and much of the Middle East, extreme forms of social
oppression were left untouched in spite of the leaders' socialist
rhetoric. Congress politicians were promising opportunities for all,
especially at election time, but then allied themselves with local
elites to the detriment of the low-caste poor. Instead of being an
instrument for social change, the Congress Party had become a tool for
families who had ruled and exploited their neighbors for generations
under colonial rule.</p>
<p>Indira Gandhi was determined to root out these shortcomings, but she
felt she needed more power in order to do so. In 1969 she nationalized
key banks and concentrated executive power within her own secretariat.
When her more radical policies led to a split in the Congress Party,
Gandhi's faction won the 1971 national elections hands-down on the
slogan "Get Rid of Poverty." She moved the country closer to a strict
centralized planning regime, in which the government was responsible for
most economic activities. When accused of betraying her father's more
liberal policy, Indira bristled. "My father was a statesman," she
responded. "I'm a political woman. My father was a saint. I'm
not."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en435en">^28^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en435}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-441}The 1971 Bangladesh war, the biggest
crisis in south Asia since independence, gave Indira Gandhi the chance
to prove that she was indeed no saint. The crisis had its origins in the
Cold War, and especially in the relationships among Pakistan, India,
China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Although the trigger
that set the war off was the Pakistani generals' abysmal treatment of
the people in the eastern half of their country, the scene had been set
by the sudden rapprochement between the United States and China through
Kissinger's Beijing visit in July 1971. This harmonization was what
Indian leaders had feared most. From the mid-1960s on, Indian security
advisers had warned that "the great temptation before the Western world
would be to prop up China as a counterweight to the USSR."</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We felt, however, that this might be a dangerous move, because there was
an essential difference between these two countries, which needed to be
recognized. The USSR also had its world-wide ambitions, but they were
pursuing these in a more peaceful manner than the Chinese. Perhaps this
was due to the fact that they had had 40 years in which to develop,
during which they also had built up some prosperity for themselves;
perhaps it was due to the realization of the dangers of nuclear war. But
ultimately the USSR presented less of a danger to the world community
than China, particularly with regard to the issue of war and peace.
China, far more than [the] USSR, would pursue her course with ruthless
determination, quite undeterred by the prospect of a large scale
war.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en436en">^29^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en436}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-442}The specific danger, for India, lay in
Pakistan's close relations with both the United States and China. The
symbolism of Kissinger leaving for Beijing from Islamabad was not lost
on India's leaders. But, in spite of its centrality in international
affairs, as a state Pakistan had been going downhill ever since its
inception in 1947. When the generals had tried to democratize in 1970,
the result was an election victory for the Awami League, an eastern
Pakistani movement that wanted to make the country into a democratic
confederation, in which the Bengali population of the east had a genuine
say. Predictably, the western Pakistani general who was president, Yahya
Khan, nullified the result and arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the
leader of the Awami League. When unrest broke out in eastern Pakistan,
the generals introduced martial law. Soldiers began attacking
neighborhoods in the east that had a high percentage of Bengali
nationalists or Pakistani Hindus. Large numbers of refugees started
crossing over to India. Both in public and in private Indira Gandhi
began describing Pakistan's policy toward the Bengalis as "genocide,"
and started preparing a military intervention. Her motives were both
humanitarian and strategic.</p>
<p>The Nixon Administration was blind to the disasters the Pakistani
generals inflicted on their own countrymen, but saw the Cold War
strategic setback the splitting up of Pakistan could lead to for the
United States. Visiting Delhi on his way to Pakistan and, secretly, from
there to Beijing, Kissinger tried to strike a pose of uncertainty on how
far the United States would go to assist Pakistan in case of a war. The
Indians would have nothing of it. When Kissinger claimed that he had
been unaware of continued US weapons' shipments to Pakistan during the
crisis, the Indian foreign minister shot back: "It is surprising that
such a high placed official as you are not given full facts.... The
embarrassment over all this is... for you. Yet it is a serious blow to
our relations." Pakistan, Foreign Minister Swaran Singh said, "has been
sustained wholly by you." With seven million refugees and increased
fighting along the eastern border, "there is a limit to what we can
take.... We would like to know whether we are coming in the way of your
interests. If we are, we would like to take a second look at our own
policies."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en437en">^30^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en437}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-443}A week later Washington and Beijing
jointly announced Nixon's forthcoming visit to China. Kissinger told the
Indian ambassador that the United States would not help his country if
China intervened in an Indian war with Pakistan. The Indian response was
swift. Picking up on proposals made earlier by the Soviets, Gandhi
agreed to a treaty of friendship between India and the Soviet Union. "In
the event of either being subjected to an attack or a threat thereof,"
said the treaty, the two sides "shall immediately enter into mutual
consultations in order to remove such
threat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en438en">^31^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en438} India
also started a large-scale program for training Bengali guerrillas to
fight in eastern Pakistan. And on the prime minister's orders, the
Indian military began preparations for a full-scale invasion of Pakistan
if diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis did not succeed fast. "The
Indo-Soviet Treaty appears to have taken both Beijing and Washington by
surprise," reported the Indian embassy in the US capital. "The treaty
represents a certain reassurance for India and a certain advance for the
Soviet Union in Asia and a corresponding setback to Sino-US
maneuvers."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en439en">^32^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en439}</p>
<p>On 4 December 1971 India launched a combined ground, sea, and air
operation against eastern Pakistan. Within a few days, the Pakistani
military in the east was crushed and a Bengali administration began
ruling the territory as independent Bangladesh. Seeing the jubilant
crowds in the capital, Dacca, it was difficult for anyone not to see the
Indian intervention as a liberation. But Nixon and Kissinger viewed it
as Indian aggression. They moved parts of the US Seventh Fleet into the
Indian Ocean and told their new Chinese friends that "we are afraid that
if nothing is done to stop it, eastern Pakistan will become a Bhutan and
western Pakistan will become a Nepal. And India with Soviet help would
be free to turn its energies
elsewhere."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en440en">^33^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en440} But
the Chinese knew that an intervention this late in the game would be
risky, and with all her military objectives reached, Indira Gandhi
quickly accepted a cease-fire. South Asia settled into a new status quo,
with India even more predominant, still nonaligned but also closer to
the USSR than ever before.</p>
<p>Nixon and Kissinger, in conversations that oozed racism and misogyny,
fumed that "the bitch" had tricked them. "We'll be paying for it for a
long time.... It will be interesting," Kissinger told the NSC, "to see
how all those people who were so horrified at what the Paks were doing
in East Pakistan react when the Indians take over
there."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en441en">^34^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en441} "What we
are seeing here," Kissinger told the president, "is a Soviet-Indian
power play to humiliate the Chinese and also somewhat us.... And the
effect of that will be on all other countries watching it is that the
friends of China and the United States have been clobbered by India and
the Soviet
Union."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en442en">^35^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en442} The
Nixon Administration set out to punish India as best it could.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-444}The sense of enmity in Washington was
reciprocated in Delhi. "Military aid to Pakistan from the US has been
one of the potent causes of the military getting the upper hand in the
internal affairs of Pakistan and in sustaining its unnatural hostile
posture towards India and ambitions over Kashmir," said one Indian
Ministry of External Affairs report to the prime
minister.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en443en">^36^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en443} "China
and USA both do not mind sacrificing Indian interests if it holds them
tighter close."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en444en">^37^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en444}
Indians, claimed another Delhi policy review, have "been bewildered and
shocked by the persistent stand of the US administration against India,
against the freedom struggle of Bangladesh and in support of the Yahya
regime [in
Pakistan]."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en445en">^38^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en445}
Indira Gandhi was not going to seek American friendship anytime soon.</p>
<p>Instead the Indian prime minister turned increasingly authoritarian in
domestic affairs and friendly toward the Soviet Union internationally.
The high point of Soviet-Indian cooperation was in the mid-1970s, as the
USSR expanded its military and economic cooperation with India,
including the building of steel plants and the exploitation of oil and
coal reserves. The Soviets were also instrumental in providing
assistance for India's "peaceful nuclear test" in 1974. "The Soviet
Union," said a 1974 Indian government report, "continued to support
India's policy of non-alignment and her contribution to the
strengthening of world peace and to the struggle for the removal of all
vestiges of colonialism, neo-colonialism and
racism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en446en">^39^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en446}</p>
<p>When Indira Gandhi in 1975 responded to a Supreme Court decision
invalidating the last elections by refusing a new vote, restricting
civil liberties, and ruling by decree under a state of emergency, the
Soviets began hoping that India would follow in the footsteps of the
People's Democracies and some postcolonial states by introducing
socialism through a one-party system. "Should small groups with the
backing of big finance, press and foreign friends, but without support
of the masses, be allowed to force their ideas upon the majority?"
Indira Gandhi asked her party. "Will there be democracy, when India is
weakened?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en447en">^40^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en447} But
Indian democracy was far too robust even for a leader of Indira Gandhi's
stature to put aside. Under pressure from increasing political unrest at
home, she called an election in 1977, which she felt certain she would
win, but ended up losing to an opposition alliance headed by former
Congress minister Morarji Desai. The first non-Congress government since
independence had little to offer in terms of new policies. But it
managed to rebuild Indian democracy after the Emergency, while keeping
its international policies in place. The aging Desai and his advisers
were afraid that the Soviets would break their links with India with
Indira Gandhi out. "Indo-Soviet relations are characterized by deep
understanding and close identity or broad similarity of views," said a
policy overview from the new foreign minister. "Friendship and
understanding with the Soviet Union has hitherto been one of the main
directions of India's foreign policy. This has both emotional content
and hard-headed logic.... Today there is a vast spectrum of
inter-weaving relations from which both political and economic
advantages have accrued to
India."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en448en">^41^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en448}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-445}The new Desai government was not going to
throw these advantages overboard. The Indian foreign secretary met
Soviet diplomats and told them that "while a number of important events
have taken place in India... it was important to remember that India
remained where it was and its foreign policy remained unchanged." The
Desai government would "preserve the character of India's foreign policy
not merely because they have inherited it but because they realized its
rationale in terms of India's interests." The Soviets and the Indians,
the foreign secretary said, "could have continued confidence in each
other and look forward to the further development [of] the many
different links of cooperation between the two countries in the interest
of mutual
benefit."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en449en">^42^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en449}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-446}At a carefully managed meeting with the
similarly senescent Brezhnev in Moscow in 1979, the Indian prime
minister tried to make sense of a rapidly changing world. The
Soviet-Indian partnership was confirmed. Both were frightened by the
rise of political Islam in nearby Iran. Asked by Desai what was really
going on in Iran, the Soviet leader confessed, "The devil only knows....
There was that uprising of the people. Thousands demonstrated.... We
always had good relations with Iran, with the Shah also. He came to us
and I went to him.... [Now] the Shah is not there. The Americans
supported him! Now there is the new regime and the Americans would like
to adapt themselves to the new regime also. The Rightists [Islamists]
have made their appearance there and they want to have close relations
with the USA."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en450en">^43^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en450}</p>
<p>To nobody's surprise, Indira Gandhi was back in charge after the 1980
elections in India. The prime minister was not exactly chastened, but
certainly more aware of her role as "a political woman" than ever. She
also feared for India's unity and cohesion in a world where issues of
identity, religion, and nation had started to replace the Cold War
ideological divide. The rise of Islamism frightened her as much as it
had Brezhnev and Desai. Already before the elections in India, the
Indian Foreign Ministry had warned the Soviets about the resistance that
the new Communist government in Afghanistan was giving rise to. "While
we could not openly say so..., our own principles of secularism did not
necessarily rejoice at the emergence of the religious fervor in many
countries which both India and the Soviet Union considered as
important," Indian foreign secretary Jagat Singh Mehta told the Soviet
ambassador.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en451en">^44^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en451} But
some of the damage was self-inflicted. "In many Arab countries," Mehta
continued, "there was a strong feeling that Islam was being threatened
by the [Communist Afghan] Khalqi government. This was of course not
India's view but we were bringing it to their notice as a friend."</p>
<p>For India, and especially for the new Indira Gandhi government after
1980, the world was turning faster than they would like to see. Most
Indian leaders, including many of those who had opposed Congress, were
wedded to India's planned economy development model. They liked to see
centralized states abroad, with whom they could negotiate on trade and
security issues. Although they complained endlessly about Sino-American
rapprochement, Soviet-American détente was in many ways in India's
interest. Indira Gandhi hoped that over time her country could develop
good working relations with the Americans also, possibly by way of
Moscow. Ethnic and religious mobilization in south Asia and the Middle
East could get in the way of such hopes, the prime minister feared.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter016.xhtml#page-447}But in returning as prime minister, she
also still felt the influence of the Cold War on India. Gandhi deplored
"the unceasing effort of other countries to mold our policies to fit in
with their global strategies." She saw more "uncritical acceptance of
foreign postulates" within India than before. "We should not imitate
other countries or other systems, nor is it our aim to become improved
editions of them," Gandhi
warned.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en452en">^45^</a>{#chapter016.xhtml#en452} But,
just as for her predecessors, Indira Gandhi's room for maneuver remained
circumscribed by the Cold War. In spite of its many efforts, even a
country as significant as India was never able to fully break away from
the global conflict molding its policies.

and its opponents. What set it apart was the intensity of its conflicts,
both domestic and international, and the significance these conflicts
achieved at the global level. At times, such as around the 1967 and 1973
wars, it seemed as if the Cold War in the Middle East had hijacked the
bipolar world for its purposes. And although not all clashes in the
region were linked to the global ideological divide, many political
leaders did their utmost to make it sound that way, both for purposes of
domestic mobilization and in order to build alliances against their
regional enemies. For Soviets and Americans, the Middle East was a
maelstrom that threatened to pull them in toward its vortex, driven by
forces they firmly believed they had an interest in, but still always
found hard to gauge.</p>
<p>At the end of World War II, most of the Middle East had been controlled
by foreign powers. British forces backed up French influence in Syria
and Lebanon, as well as further west in the Maghreb. The British
themselves occupied Palestine and dominated the governments in Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, and the Gulf states. Most of the Arabian peninsula was
controlled by the conservative, religious Saudi monarchy in alliance
with US oil companies. Iran was occupied by the Soviets in the north and
the British in the south, ostensibly to keep its oil riches from falling
into German hands. It was a colonial world through and through, where
Arabs and Persians were always reminded of their status as dominated and
controlled.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-450}A decade or so later this political
landscape was transformed. British and French domination was
increasingly a thing of the past, and the 1956 Suez Crisis confirmed
European frailties. So did France's failing colonial war in Algeria.
Arab nationalist revolutions were driving politics in Egypt, Syria, and
Iraq. Palestine was divided between the new religiously defined state of
Israel and territories occupied by Egypt and Jordan. In this rapidly
changing Middle East successive US Administrations, and their European
and Japanese allies, believed that it was critical to secure oil
supplies and retain a Western strategic presence. The Soviets,
meanwhile, hoped that radical nationalists would break away from
capitalist control and form alliances with Moscow. Some CPSU
theoreticians thought that shutting off cheap Middle Eastern oil could
help produce the ultimate crisis of capitalism, while Red Army planners
knew that in case of war NATO armies depended on imported oil. On both
sides, it was a heady mix of dreams and apprehensions that linked the
Middle East's nightmarish politics with the Cold War conflict.</p>
<p>In addition to its oil supplies, there were two other main connectors
between the Middle East and Cold War. One was the conflict within the
region between secular and religious politics. In every country in the
Middle East, secularists---mainly, but not always,
socialists---confronted those who believed that government should be
organized according to religious prescripts. In the Arab world, the
nationalists who had the upper hand were socialist secularists who
admitted some role for religion, but generally persecuted the Islamists,
the minority who believed in religious rule. An exception was Saudi
Arabia, but even there the conservative aristocrats in power were far
too preoccupied securing their own income from the country's oil wealth
and exploiting their US alliance for domestic security purposes to risk
any independent Islamist activity. In Iran, set apart from the Arab
Middle East by language, culture, and confession, a young monarch intent
on modernizing his country under US auspices ruthlessly persecuted those
members of the Shia clergy who believed in religious rule. The Shah
felt, with good reason in the 1950s and '60s, that the majority of
conservative mullahs would support him against his arch enemies, the
Left and the Iranian Communist Party.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-451}The other connector was the creation of a
new Jewish state in the Middle East. Both the United States and the
Soviet Union had supported the state of Israel at its inception. But
they had done so for very different reasons. For the Americans, Israel
was a refuge for Jews from the European Holocaust and, at least for
some, the fulfillment of the biblical prophesy of the Jews' return to
their ancestral homeland. It was also the introduction of Western
modernity into the Middle East and a potential ally for US foreign
policy in the region. For the Soviets, Israel---at least at
first---meant more trouble for the British and a victory for a kind of
Left-wing Zionism with which even the deeply anti-Semitic Stalin thought
he could work with over time. Israel might also be a solution to his own
Jewish problem. Stalin had nothing against the thought of sending
elderly, infirm, or politically undesirable Soviet Jews to Israel, just
like he had moved whole peoples around inside the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Both Americans and Soviets turned out to have been very mistaken in
terms of the significance of the Jewish state for themselves and for the
region. Israel's defeat of the Arab countries in 1948 and the strength
and cohesion of Israeli society made it into a force to be reckoned with
on its own terms. Israel was beholden to US assistance but not dependent
on it, at least not until the 1967 war. It confronted anti-Semitism in
the Soviet bloc, simply because it existed there more than anywhere
else. But the biggest mistake of the Superpowers in the Middle East was
to misjudge the vigor and advance of Arab nationalism, fueled in part by
the creation of a Jewish state on Arab territory. For many Arabs, the
existence and success of Israel, paired with the number of Palestinian
Arab refugees, served as constant reminders of the need to create a
unified and powerful Arab nationalist movement that could redeem the
Arab nation and speed it toward a modernity of its own.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-452}<strong>A[RAB NATIONALISM, LIKE]{.small-caps}</strong>
other forms of European and Asian nationalisms, came out of the
nineteenth century. It found its contemporary form in the years after
World War I, after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When European
countries refused to give Arab countries their independence, but instead
proceeded with a full-scale recolonization of the Middle East,
nationalist groups staged open revolts. In 1919 massive demonstrations
in Egypt demanded full autonomy and the end of British control. In Iraq
the population rebelled the following year. The British crushed the
uprising with up to ten thousand Iraqis dead. The 1925 Syrian and
Lebanese revolt against French rule cost at least six thousand lives. By
the end of World War II, if not before, nationalism was in command of
local politics all over the Arab world, and the colonial regimes were
receding.</p>
<p>But Arab nationalism did not stop with demands for national
independence. For many Arab nationalists, the monarchical regimes that
gradually replaced direct colonial rule were almost as bad as the
British and French. Nationalist leaders viewed these kings and sheikhs
as outgrowths of the colonial presence, who were keen on striking
compromises with the former colonial powers for their own personal gain.
One by one Arab kings were overthrown by movements that criticized their
"society of the half percent" and demanded rapid modernization alongside
social equality. The young officers who removed Egypt's King Farouk in
1952 stressed anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and abolition of
monopolies as their policy. They also saw the Arab monarchies' failure
to win against Israel in 1948 as a sign of moral decay. "The Arab
peoples entered Palestine with the same degree of enthusiasm," wrote
Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of the 1952 Egyptian revolution. "They
did so on the basis of... a common estimate shared by all as to the
outer borders of their security. These peoples left Palestine with a
common bitterness and disappointment; then, each in its own internal
affairs encountered the same factors, the same ruling forces that had
brought about their defeat, and forced them to bow their heads in
humiliation and
shame."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en453en">^1^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en453}</p>
<p>Nasser's speeches on Palestine made clear how far he and other
nationalists had come in regarding all Arabs as <em>one</em> people. Even
though the Arab world had been politically disunited since the
thirteenth century, it was quite natural that revolutionaries who wanted
rapid change hoped that Arab cultural unity could be translated into a
common purpose, not least because it would give added significance to
themselves and to their movements. "When the struggle was over in
Palestine," wrote Nasser, "the Arab circle in my eyes had become a
single entity.... I have followed developments in the Arab countries,
and I find they match, point for point. What happened in Cairo had its
counterpart in Damascus the next day, and in Beirut, Amman, Baghdad and
elsewhere.... It is a single region. The same circumstances, the same
factors, even the same forces, united against all of it... the foremost
of these forces was
imperialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en454en">^2^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en454}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-453}Born in 1918, Nasser was an army officer
with strong Egyptian nationalist and Pan-Arab views. He saw the struggle
for Egyptian independence as part of a wider Arab liberation struggle,
which in turn linked to global anti-imperialist and Third World
concerns. From the beginning of his political career, Nasser believed in
a vague form of socialism, but it had to be a form of governance
developed by Arabs themselves in accordance with the principles of
Islam. Although Nasser admired the Soviet economic system, he was
fearful of Communist political influence in Egypt, and on several
occasions imprisoned Left-wing leaders when he thought they went too far
in their criticism of the government. But his main domestic enemy was
what he considered the religious Right. Nasser openly mocked the Muslim
Brotherhood and banned all Islamist organizations after an infuriated
member of the Brotherhood tried to assassinate him in 1954. For the
Egyptian leader, Islam was first and foremost an inspiration for Arab
liberation and regional unity. He abolished Sharia courts and made the
religious authorities in Egypt---seen by many worldwide as the main
Islamic theologians---issue a fatwa, which said that all Muslims,
whether Sunni, Shia, or sectarian, belonged to the same Muslim
community.</p>
<p>Nasser's views on the Cold War were straightforward. He believed that
the United States, Britain, and France would attempt to control the Arab
world even after the end of colonialism. He saw the conservative Muslim
monarchies in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan, and the Gulf states as
instruments in this political and economic oppression. Like the Indians
and Indonesia under Sukarno, Nasser turned to the Soviet Union because
he believed that Moscow could be an alternative supplier of economic and
military aid and know-how. The Soviets, for Nasser, were a likely ally
in the struggle for his political aims in the Arab world. His form of
nonalignment was one in which he guarded his independence, united with
other Third World countries, and worked ever-more closely with the
Soviets in the pursuit of Nasser's own aims. Domestically, his proof of
his Cold War policies' success was the Soviet financing of the Aswan
Dam, the world's largest dam project, which Nasser sought and received
after he felt that the Americans would attach political strings to their
aid. When the Eisenhower Administration furiously withdrew its offer of
assistance, the Soviets designed and helped build the dam, which was
completed in 1970.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-454}Internationally, Nasser also benefitted
from his increasing closeness with the Soviet Union. In the 1960s Egypt
fought an outdrawn conflict with the Saudis in support of the revolution
in Yemen. Nasser's aim was to show the other regional powers that Egypt
was in control of the fate of the Arab revolution all over the Middle
East. The Soviets and other Communist countries gave substantial support
to the more than seventy thousand Egyptian troops who served in Yemen.
The Yemeni royalists were supported by Britain and the United States, as
well as Jordan and Iran, in addition to the Saudis. Nasser's
intervention got entangled in Yemeni tribal relations and clan
differences, and was at a logistical disadvantage due to Saudi proximity
across Yemen's northern border and British access from its colony in
Aden. The Egyptian president fumed that even the shoes of the dead
Egyptian soldiers "are more honorable than the crowns of King Saud and
King Hussein."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en455en">^3^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en455}
But by the late 1960s Nasser's effort in Yemen had fizzled out, with big
losses and few achievements, even though the Egyptian presence left
behind reservoirs of radicalism in the south of Arabia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-455}But other movements than Nasser's also had
their eyes on the cause of Pan-Arabism. The Arab Ba'ath [Renaissance]
Party was founded in Damascus in 1940 by Michel Aflaq, a former
Communist from a Christian Syrian family who believed in a regimented
mass movement that would renew the Arab quest for political and cultural
unity. Aflaq and his followers welcomed the revolution in Egypt but
criticized Nasser for being self-serving and too centered on Egyptian
interests. Instead, the Ba'ath leadership wanted to build Arab unity
from below, with branches of the party in each country, all intent on
taking power and unifying the Arab world around an authoritarian,
nationalist, and socialist program. The Ba'ath leaders were the vanguard
who would break with generations of backwardness, fragmentation, and
European domination. They, Aflaq said, have "the will that the nation
lacked, as a daring model and example of movement from passiveness and
slumber to awakening and
action."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en456en">^4^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en456}</p>
<p>As is often the case with parties that put unity above all other
virtues, the Ba'ath experienced its fair share of infighting from the
very beginning of the party's existence. Some of its members supported
the merger of Syria and Egypt into a United Arab Republic in 1958, in
spite of the party's criticism of Nasser. That union ended in acrimony
three years later. In Iraq some members supported the 1958 revolution,
which overthrew the monarchy, only to see the party crushed there a year
later. But in spite of its disunity, the influence of the various
branches of the Ba'ath Party increased in many Arab countries in the
late 1950s and early 1960s. For many Arabs who wanted revolutionary
change without embracing Communism, Ba'athist thinking served their
purposes well.</p>
<p>The revolution in Iraq in 1958 was a watershed in the Cold War in the
Middle East. The military regime that took power allied itself with the
miniscule Iraqi Communist Party, in part because the new president, Abd
al-Karim Qasim, distrusted the Ba'ath. Qasim also wanted an alliance
with the Soviets to protect his regime against Western intervention,
like the one in Iran five years earlier. The revolution was bloody. The
king and fourteen members of his family were gunned down at the palace.
The British embassy was sacked. US leaders, understandably, were
horrified. Within weeks, Iraq had gone from being a US ally central to
its security architecture to joining with its opponents, Nasser and the
Soviets. "We either act now or get out of the Middle East," President
Eisenhower told his advisers. "To lose this area by inaction would be
far worse than the loss in China, because of the strategic position and
resources of the Middle
East."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en457en">^5^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en457} Always
watchful for falling dominoes, Eisenhower wanted to confront what he saw
as a direct Soviet challenge to US power in the Middle East. "Our
military advisers," Secretary of State Dulles told Congress, "believe we
now hold a considerable superiority which the USSR would not want to
challenge.... So, it is a probability that if we act decisively and
promptly, they may figure that Nasser has gone too fast. They may
withdraw before their prestige is engaged and general war
risked."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en458en">^6^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en458}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-456}The immediate US response showed clearly
the limitations of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Acting on
a request from Lebanon's president Chamoun, Eisenhower sent eight
thousand US marines to land in Beirut. The president referred to
Communist subversion of Lebanon and the need to "preserve its
territorial integrity and political
independence."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en459en">^7^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en459}
But in reality the landing was an almost desperate attempt to
demonstrate US power and purpose in the Middle East. The aim was to
frighten the Soviets from too deep an involvement with Middle Eastern
revolutions and to warn the new Iraqi leaders away from taking
possession of Kuwait, an oil-rich sheikdom that most Iraqis regarded as
part of their national territory. More than half of Britain's oil
imports came from Kuwait, and its loss would mean that western Europe
and Japan would be in dire straits in terms of energy supplies.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Khrushchev observed the revolutions in the Middle East with
satisfaction and not a little glee. "Can we imagine a Baghdad Pact
without Baghdad? This consideration alone is enough to give Dulles a
nervous breakdown," the Soviet leader grinned to his comrades in
Moscow.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en460en">^8^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en460} But
Khrushchev was not about to give the new Iraqi leaders, or their
Egyptian backers, any hard guarantees against US interventions. He told
Nasser, who flew to Moscow for an urgent meeting in the wake of the US
troop landings in Lebanon, that he would not provide sophisticated
weapons systems for Arab use. "If the need arises," the Soviet leader
argued, "then it would be better to launch [these weapons] from our
territory.... [And] you can be assured that if aggressors start a war
against your country, then we will help you by means of these
rockets."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en461en">^9^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en461}
Khrushchev found the Middle East to be a hopeful but confusing region,
where Soviet power could do little but prod the new regimes in the
direction of social reform, socialist planning, and ever-closer
military, political, and economic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-457}Soviet room for action in the Middle East
was caught between its experts' Marxist analysis of class-struggle and
the political and strategic aims of its leaders. Both the Arab and the
Persian Middle East were seen as too backward for genuine socialist
revolutions. Their immediate future would be nationalist revolutions
against Western imperialist domination carried out by the local
bourgeoisie and its allies. The Soviet Union should be a backer of such
revolutions, although it had to realize their character, which was
defined by the narrow local self-interest of their protagonists. But
while Middle Eastern bourgeois nationalists could not have the same
global class perspective as Soviet or eastern European Communists, they
could still be part of an international front against the West. Soviet
purposes in the Middle East did not need true socialist revolutions.
They only needed movements and regimes that rebelled against Western
control of their resources, and that sought Soviet support in doing so.</p>
<p>Soviet and American views of Israel also attempted to fit complex local
realities into shallow Cold War frameworks. At least up to the Suez
Crisis, the Soviets retained some hope that the Zionist state could be
amenable to Moscow's positions in international affairs, thereby making
it possible for them to broker a settlement between it and its Arab
neighbors. This view was not as far-fetched as it sounds today.
Bolshevism and Zionism had grown up politically side by side in Russia
and eastern Europe, as socialist rivals and sometimes as enemies. "The
struggle between the Zionist and Bolshevik Jews," Churchill had
proclaimed back in 1920, "is little less than a struggle for the soul of
the Jewish
people."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en462en">^10^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en462} But up
to 1948 British imperial policies, not the Arabs or the Soviets, had
been Zionism's deadliest enemy. The willingness of an Israeli Labor
government under Ben-Gurion to align itself totally with the British and
French at Suez therefore came as a bit of a shock to Moscow.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-458}Knowing what was going on in Israel, the
country's alliances should not have come as a surprise. For Israel's
Labor government, confronting the country's Arab neighbors was a
question of survival. And to uphold this confrontation, Western support
was necessary. "When we are isolated," explained Ben-Gurion, "the Arabs
think that we can be destroyed and the Soviets exploit this card. If a
great power stood behind us, and the Arabs knew that we are a fact that
cannot be altered, Russia will cease her hostility towards us, because
this hostility would no longer buy the heart of the
Arabs."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en463en">^11^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en463} The
Israeli leaders' suspicions were confirmed through Soviet agreements
with Egypt in the wake of the 1956 war. The Zionists felt that they had
to move closer to the Americans. Soviet anti-Semitism, which Khrushchev
never confronted openly, also helped convince Ben-Gurion and other
Jewish leaders that the Communist state could never become a friend of
Israel.</p>
<p>For Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Soviet alliance brought its frustrations. He
had hoped to use Soviet military and economic aid to position Egypt as
the primary power within the
region.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en464en">^12^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en464} Instead,
the economy took a downward turn in the 1960s, mainly caused by low
productivity, corruption, high military expenditure, and excessive free
distribution of goods and services. Meanwhile, the long war in Yemen
impressed nobody; the United Arab Republic was dissolved by the Syrians
in 1961; and Qasim was overthrown and murdered in Iraq in 1963. In both
Syria and Iraq the Ba'ath Party was in ascendance, in spite of both
Egyptian and Soviet disapproval. By the mid-1960s, Ba'ath governments
were in place in both Damascus and Baghdad, even though they saw eye to
eye on few things, except persecuting Communists, Islamic leaders, and
ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-459}The Cold War in the 1960s gave Nasser a
chance to reset his international stature. While continuing to work
closely with the Soviets, the Egyptian leader intensified his engagement
with and on behalf of revolutionary movements in the Third World. Such
positions, Nasser felt, enabled him to break out of a local framework
that he often found irksome. Especially after the fall of Ben Bella in
Algeria in 1965, Cairo became the meeting point of African
revolutionaries from Angola to Morocco. The Afro-Asian Peoples'
Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) was headquartered in Cairo, and even
though Soviet influence in the association increased in the late 1960s,
Nasser always made sure that he could put his personal imprimatur on its
usually nebulous
proceedings.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en465en">^13^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en465}</p>
<p>Nasser's Third World engagements and his need to be seen as the
principal champion of all Arabs, especially after the Yemeni debacle,
led him to focus more than he had in the past on the plight of the
Palestinians. Since 1948, more than a million stateless Palestinians had
lived as refugees all over the Arab world. Their existence was
precarious. Most Arab regimes refused them the right of citizenship and
they were often exploited in terms of work and living conditions. But by
the mid-1960s Palestinian organizations had become more visible, and one
of them, Fatah, led by a former student at Cairo University, Yasir
Arafat, had begun small-scale armed attacks against Israel. "We will not
put down our arms as long as Palestine is not liberated and until
Palestine occupies the status it deserves in the heart of the Arab
nation," Arafat
declared.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en466en">^14^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en466}</p>
<p>The origins of the 1967 Middle East war are to be found in the
intersection between the Arab rediscovery of the Palestinian cause and
the intensifying Cold War in the region. Playing Arab leaders against
each other in their search for support, in 1966 Fatah had relocated from
Egypt to Syria, where a radical faction of the Ba'ath Party was now in
command. In spite of the difficult relationship between them and the
Ba'ath Party in the past, the Soviets also threw their weight behind the
new regime in Damascus, hoping it would mean a Ba'athist realignment
with Moscow. If that were to be the case, the balance in the Middle
Eastern Cold War would tip decisively toward the Soviets, Brezhnev
believed. Soviet arms deliveries to both Syria and Egypt intensified, as
did Arab rhetoric against Jewish occupation of Palestine.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-460}In April 1967 Israel responded to Fatah
incursions from Syria and Jordan by strafing the forces of the two
countries with aircraft and tanks. Israeli jet fighters overflew
Damascus. The Soviets believed the Israelis were preparing a full-scale
attack on Syria, and warned their local allies. Fearful of being seen as
less anti-Israel than the Ba'athists and alarmed by the information from
Moscow, Nasser moved his troops toward the Israeli border and blockaded
its sea access from the Gulf of Aqaba. The Soviets and the Syrians hoped
that Egyptian pressure on Israel would temper Israeli bellicosity
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Instead, fear of a concerted Arab action made Israel decide to strike
first. On 5 June 1967, in a surprise attack, its air force destroyed the
Egyptian air force on the ground. Its armies then conquered the Sinai
peninsula, threatening Cairo, and responded to shelling from the
Jordanian side by conquering East Jerusalem and the West Bank of the
river Jordan. In the north Israeli troops routed the Syrians, taking
possession of the Golan Heights. In less than a week of fighting,
Israel's Arab neighbors had suffered a total military defeat. In the
Sinai Desert, row after row of burned-out T-34 tanks, supplied by the
Soviets to the Egyptian army, bore witness to the scale of the Arab
humiliation and its Cold War significance.</p>
<p>The United States had stayed out of the war as best it could. But even
if the only US casualties were the crew on a Navy spy ship accidentally
(it was claimed) sunk by the Israelis, US public opinion was firmly on
the side of Israel. Though the Jewish state was undoubtedly the
aggressor, the scale of its victory against much larger forces made it a
David fighting Goliath. Americans also liked that the Israelis did what
the United States itself seemed incapable of doing in Indochina: giving
a licking to the Soviet Union and its allies. The humiliation of
aggressively anti-American Arab regimes also suited Washington. "We're
going to start sorting these people out a bit," President Johnson's
national security adviser McGeorge Bundy told his White House
colleagues.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en467en">^15^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en467}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-461}For the new Soviet leadership the Arab
defeat was a massive setback. The lead-up to the war had shown Moscow's
diplomacy to be fumbling and uncertain. While advising Egypt and Syria
to tone down their rhetoric so as to avoid war, the Soviets' warning
about an impending Israeli attack had helped make that attack a reality.
But first and foremost it was the scale of the Arab losses that shocked
Moscow. "The data at our disposal," an exasperated Leonid Brezhnev
explained to his Warsaw Pact colleagues on 20 June, "shows clearly that
due to this generous aid rendered by the USSR and other countries, Arab
countries were indisputably superior to Israel in weapons and military
personnel prior to the outbreak of hostilities." The Arab leaders had
failed because of lack of coordination among themselves and with the
Soviet Union. Only a Soviet ultimatum, sent to the Americans, brought
the Israeli offensive to an end. But the Soviets, Brezhnev said, would
continue to support the "progressive" Arab states, since Moscow was
convinced that the United States had encouraged and facilitated the
Israeli attack.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en468en">^16^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en468}</p>
<p>Nasser offered to resign but stayed on after massive demonstrations in
Cairo and other cities demanded that he remain. The defeat may have
dented the president's popularity but had not destroyed it. Together
with the Syrians, and with Soviet support, the Egyptians kept their
confrontational stance toward Israel. The "War of Attrition," as Nasser
called it, consisted of small-scale attacks on Israeli forces, while
avoiding an all-out war. In each case the Israelis struck back with what
the new Labor prime minister, Golda Meir, straightforwardly called an
asymmetrical response: to do more damage to the Arabs than what they
could do to Israel. Meir refused to withdraw her troops from the
occupied territories. "There is no substitute for our consolidation
along the cease-fire lines in view of the fact that the Arabs still
refuse to make peace," she
claimed.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en469en">^17^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en469}</p>
<p>The 1967 war added to the Palestinian tragedy. New refugees, this time
from the West Bank and Gaza, settled in the surrounding Arab states. In
Jordan and Lebanon they became a key part of the population, and their
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) a key part of the political
landscape. The PLO was a loose confederation of Fatah and other groups,
with Yasir Arafat as the leader. They continued to carry out small-scale
attacks against Israel. But the PLO became increasingly fractious. One
group, the Patriotic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a
self-declared Marxist-Leninist party that claimed Che Guevara among its
heroes, hijacked a US plane in 1969 and forced it to land in Damascus,
where the group was headquartered. A year later the PFLP pulled off a
much larger operation: it hijacked four Western planes and flew three of
them to Jordan, where they blew them up.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-462}Even though all the hostages were
released, the terror operation provided Jordan's King Hussein with the
excuse he had been waiting for to tame the Palestinian presence in his
country. Accusing the PLO and other Palestinian groups of behaving as a
state within the state, the king sent his forces to drive them out of
Jordan. To the surprise of most observers, the Jordanians succeeded, in
spite of Syrian threats to intervene. "Black September," as the
Palestinians called it, was a landmark in the Middle Eastern Cold War.
Arab unity had been broken. The PLO leadership, even though it had been
opposed to terror against foreign targets, was tainted by its conflict
with other Arabs and its links with international terrorist
organizations. The Soviet Union, which had cautiously begun to build
links with the PLO, was again humiliated in the Middle East, this time
by a "plucky little king" whom they considered a relic of the past in
the region.</p>
<p>The Soviets responded to Black September by intensifying their buildup
of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Internally, Brezhnev explained his
policies by stressing that the Soviet Union wanted a political
compromise in the Middle East, and that a diplomatic solution could only
be possible when Israel and its US backers realized that there was a
true balance of power in the region. The increasing Soviet involvement
was not contrary to détente, he explained. "Our party has always...
proven that the policy of peaceful co-existence is not in opposition to,
but rather strengthens the process of global revolution," Brezhnev told
his colleagues.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en470en">^18^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en470}
By 1970 the Soviets had resupplied the Egyptian army and air force, and
provided much more advanced missiles than the Egyptians had had before.
Red Army personnel manned Egyptian positions along the Suez Canal. "At
Nikolayev," one of them recounted later, "they dressed us in civvies,
issued us smart foreign-tailored suits (from Socialist-bloc countries).

personal effects and military documents and boarded the cruise liner

<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-463}With Soviet S-125 anti-aircraft missiles
in place and Soviet pilots flying missions over Egypt the balance in the
Middle East did begin to shift. There is no doubt that the cease-fire
that Israel agreed to in August 1970, which allowed the S-125 missiles
to remain on the canal banks, was a product of the new Soviet
intervention. About twenty thousand Soviet advisers served in Egypt
between 1967 and 1971, most of them in military positions. Negotiations
began on a defense treaty that would make Egypt the closest thing to a
Soviet ally outside of the Warsaw Pact. The Nixon Administration stepped
up its military support for Israel, while trying to get Soviet support
for a peace deal. A "settlement which is painful to both sides and
Soviets sell to UAR [Egypt] would be in our interest," Henry Kissinger
explained to the NSC. "From point of view of our overall relationship,
we want a settlement that is unpalatable to UAR and Soviets have paid
the price of selling
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en472en">^20^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en472}</p>
<p>The sudden death of Gamal Abdel Nasser in October 1970 dramatically
changed politics in Egypt. His successor, Anwar Sadat, was caught in an
ironic situation. On the one hand, he wanted to put pressure on the
Soviets to further increase their military support for his regime. On
the other, he believed the Egyptians at some point would have to talk
with Washington to get an overall peace agreement for the Middle East.
After signing the new defense treaty with the Soviets in 1971, a year
later he protested against Soviet reluctance to supply advanced
longer-range missiles to Egypt by capriciously expelling some (but not
all) Soviet military advisers. He also opened secret channels of
communication with the Americans. President Nixon, impatient with
Israeli reluctance to negotiate with the Arabs, suspended US military
aid to put pressure on Golda Meir. For Nixon it was much more important
to get the Soviets out of Egypt, and eventually out of the Middle East,
than to make Israel invulnerable to an attack.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-464}The ultimate irony of Sadat's first years
in power is that he wanted peace with Israel based on the pre-1967
borders, but saw no other way to achieve his objective than through
forcing a military solution. Convinced that the Arab armies now were up
to the task of if not defeating, then causing serious damage to the
Israelis, he began preparing an attack. With the Soviet position much
reduced and the Americans still on the sidelines, there was little that
could hold Sadat back. On 6 October 1973, on the eve of Yom Kippur, the
holiest day in Judaism, the Egyptian and Syrian armies attacked across
the cease-fire lines. The Israeli army was pushed back both in the Sinai
and on the Golan Heights, with substantial losses. It was clear that
Israel had problems assembling enough men and materiel to fight
effectively on both fronts. By 9 October Meir ordered the Israeli
nuclear forces, which the country had developed secretly in the late
1960s, to be readied. Her move was both an attempt to force the
Americans to provide military assistance and an ultimate guarantee
against a full-scale Arab invasion. At Kissinger's insistence, US
military resupplies started that day. The Soviets had already begun
resupplying their Arab allies.</p>
<p>The surprising Israeli setbacks in the first phase of the October War
meant that the conflict quickly took on a Cold War dimension. "The Arabs
may even be smelling a victory, not a stalemate," Kissinger said. "That
means the Soviet Union has won. For us to have gone in to have saved the
Arabs' ass would have been
perfect."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en473en">^21^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en473} But,
as things were, the Americans even refused to join the Soviets in a UN
Security Council call for an immediate cease-fire. Washington wanted
status quo restored because even a small loss of occupied territory for
Israeli would have meant a victory for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>With US resupplies underway, Israel could go on the offensive. On 11
October its forces crossed the former cease-fire line on the Golan
Heights and headed toward Damascus. On 15 October the Israelis crossed
the Suez Canal and began pushing toward Ismailia and Cairo. The Soviets
bristled at what they saw as US-Israeli collusion to secure even further
territorial gains for the Jewish state or, possibly, overthrow the
regimes in Syria and Egypt. When the Americans finally agreed to a UN
cease-fire resolution, which was accepted by all parties, the Israelis
continued their advance in some sectors. This brought their troops to
within forty kilometers of Damascus and one hundred kilometers of Cairo.
The Egyptian Third Army, thirty-five thousand men, was surrounded.
Brezhnev sent Nixon a message. In it he threatened a direct Red Army
intervention if the Israeli offensives did not end. US intelligence
reported that they believed Soviet troops were being readied to be sent
to the Middle East.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-465}On the evening of 25 October, Nixon
responded by putting US forces worldwide on alert. Strategic Air
Command, Continental Air Defense Command, European Command, and the
Sixth Fleet all went to DEFCON 3, the highest level of combat readiness
since the Cuban missile crisis. With Nixon already beleaguered by the
Watergate scandal, Kissinger believed that "the overall strategy of the
Soviets now appears to be one of throwing détente on the table since we
have no functional President, in their eyes, and, consequently, we must
prevent them from getting away with
this."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en474en">^22^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en474} While
Nixon signaled to the Soviets that Red Army troops in the Middle East
would mean war with the United States, Kissinger put maximum pressure on
the Israelis to cease their violations of the truce.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the Politburo was shocked when they picked up the US nuclear
alert. The discussion that followed made it clear that the Soviet
leaders had not reached any decision on sending troops to the Middle
East; theirs had been merely threats and contingency planning. "It is
not reasonable to become engaged in a war with the United States because
of Egypt and Syria," Kosygin
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en475en">^23^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en475} Brezhnev
summed up by saying that the Soviet warnings had, after all, had the
intended effect: the Americans were reining in the Israelis. But the
Soviet Union was quick to accept a US-sponsored resolution that gave the
UN the responsibility of separating the fighting armies. In a rambling
press conference in Washington, Nixon credited his détente policy with
resolving the crisis. It was, he said, because he and Brezhnev "have had
this personal contact, that notes exchanged in that way result in a
settlement rather than a
confrontation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en476en">^24^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en476}
But neither side was in doubt that the 1973 war had exposed some of the
limitations of détente.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-466}The despair within Arab states over the
outcome of the October War was palatable. Libya had announced an embargo
on oil exports to the United States and others who were backing Israel.
To Kissinger's horror all other Arab oil producers followed suit,
including stalwart US allies such as Saudi Arabia. The embargo led to a
massive increase in the price of oil, which in itself contributed to the
West's economic woes during the mid-1970s. In spite of US pressure, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was keen to
regulate production to keep prices high even after the embargo ended.
Oil, which in spite of increases in demand had been cheap and abundant
ever since the 1940s, now doubled in price. OPEC's price policies
encouraged those in the Third World who sought a new international
economic order based on higher prices for raw materials. It also made
the installation of a real US hegemony in the Middle East a more
pressing concern for Washington.</p>
<p>Kissinger had realized that the United States needed to be seen as
contributing to some form of peace deal in the Middle East if the Soviet
Union were to be pushed back. And putting pressure on the Israelis to
withdraw from at least some of the occupied territories was essential
for any negotiations to work, the secretary of state thought. The 1973
war could help convince Golda Meir that her country needed a deal. The
Israelis, Kissinger said, "have lost their invincibility and the Arabs
have lost their sense of
inferiority."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en477en">^25^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en477}
But Meir's government refused to play ball, except on military
disengagement agreements, which Kissinger skillfully negotiated. Even
with Sadat's Egypt increasingly turning away from the Soviet Union, in
spite of the support it had given during the war, the Americans got
little help from the Israelis to completely turn the tables on Moscow.</p>
<p>"The Middle East," Kissinger explained to President Gerald Ford right
after he had taken office in August 1974, "is the worst problem we face.
The oil situation is the worst we face.... But we can't afford another
embargo. If we are faced with that, we may have to take some oil
fields."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en478en">^26^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en478} When
Meir's Labor successor, Yitzhak Rabin, refused to agree to an interim
accord with the Egyptians in March 1975, as proposed by Washington,
President Ford lost patience. He wrote to Rabin "to convey my deep
disappointment over the position taken by Israel during the course of
the negotiations.... The failure to achieve an agreement is bound to
have far-reaching effects in the area and on our relations. I have
directed an immediate reassessment of U.S.... relations with Israel,
with a view to assuring that the overall interests of America in the
Middle East and globally will be protected. You will be informed of our
decisions."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en479en">^27^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en479}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-467}But the US president was increasingly
under pressure at home from those who believed that the global détente
policy had given too much to the Soviets. With Kissinger protesting
furiously that his Middle East policy rather aimed at taking something
<em>away</em> from the Soviet Union, seventy-six senators from both parties
wrote to President Ford attempting to undermine his new stance. "We
believe," they said, "that a strong Israel constitutes a most reliable
barrier to domination of the area by outside parties. Given the recent
heavy flow of Soviet weaponry to Arab states, it is imperative that we
not permit the military balance to shift against Israel. We believe that
preserving the peace requires that Israel obtain a level of military and
economic support adequate to deter a renewal of war by Israel's
neighbors."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en480en">^28^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en480}</p>
<p>For an unelected president hoping to win the presidency in 1976, this
pressure was too much to bear. The American Israel Public Affairs
Committee and some Jewish organizations in the United States were able
to link their fear of the United States not being supportive enough of
Israel with the rising criticism of détente. Groups on the Right, often
called neoconservatives because of their eclectic background in
libertarian thinking, human rights promotion, and foreign policy
militancy, took up these allegations. In their eyes, Nixon, Ford, and
Kissinger were bartering away support for the only true friend the
United States had in the Middle East, just like they had bartered away
support for oppressed people in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Standing tall against the Soviet Union meant standing with Israel.
President Ford's own rhetoric became remarkably more pro-Israel as the
presidential campaign got underway.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-468}The development in American politics was
in a way a parallel to what was happening in Israel itself. The Cold War
came to overwhelm the democratic promise of Israel. From a republic
fighting for the right to self-determination, Israel after 1967 became
an occupying power whose politics moved significantly to the Right.
Rabin's Labor Party lost the 1977 elections to a conservative coalition,
the Likud. It was the first time since the founding of Israel that Labor
was out of government. The new prime minister, Menachem Begin, had been
the leader of Irgun, one of the terrorist organizations fighting for
Israel's independence before 1948, and had been marginalized in Israeli
politics ever since because of his extreme views. The Likud's election
manifesto had made clear that "the right of the Jewish people to the
Land of Israel is eternal, and is an integral part of its right to
security and peace. Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] shall therefore
not be relinquished to foreign rule; between the sea and the Jordan,
there will be Jewish sovereignty
alone."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en481en">^29^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en481} As he
took office, Begin had made up his mind that he wanted peace with
Israel's neighbors, but not at the expense of the new conquests in the
east.</p>
<p>The Palestinian organizations, meanwhile, made any form of negotiations
harder to achieve. This was in part because of Arafat's despair over
lack of support from Arab states. But it was also because he feared that
any settlement that would be made with the Israelis would happen at
great cost to the Palestinians. His people's only hope, Arafat thought,
was that the Cold War would prevent Arab countries from seeking separate
deals with their enemies. Palestinian terrorism was most of all intent
on making it more difficult to ignore their cause. In 1972 a terrorist
group attacked Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, killing twelve
people, and there were a series of hijackings of international flights.
Not all of these were carried out by the PLO, but Arafat refused to
condemn any form of Palestinian violence. In the short term, this
strategy without a doubt gave prominence to the Palestinian cause and
dominated the news media, but in the longer term it proved catastrophic,
as its recklessness and nihilism alienated many states and individuals
who might otherwise have sympathized with the Palestinians' plight.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-469}With Sadat's Egypt attempting to get US
support for a peace with Israel, other Arab countries moved closer to
the Soviet
Union.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en482en">^30^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en482} Two
different factions of the Ba'ath Party were in power in Syria and Iraq.
Syria's leader Hafez al-Assad despised his Iraqi colleagues, and they
hated him back in equal measure. Saddam Hussein, who became the key
leader in Iraq in the mid-1970s, believed that the Syrians were out to
kill him and force a unification of the two countries under Assad's
leadership. Both countries, however, turned to the Soviets and eastern
Europeans to help them out, both in terms of security and economic
development. For the Soviets, close links with these two regimes served
to mitigate---perhaps essentially in their own minds---the disaster of
Sadat's defection to the US side. Soviet experts were of course aware of
the self-serving fickleness of both Ba'ath regimes. They knew how the
Syrians and the Iraqis persecuted Communists, about high-level
corruption, and about the nepotism of the leaders. But the International
Department of the Soviet Communist Party, in particular, argued that the
Ba'athists were bourgeois nationalists who had broken with imperialism,
and therefore worthy of Soviet support.</p>
<p>By the late 1970s extensive Soviet-led support programs were in place
for both countries. To a higher degree than before, the Soviets
delegated some of the assistance for Syria and Iraq to the eastern
European states, especially to East Germany and Bulgaria. Of the three
thousand Soviet bloc advisers in Syria in 1979, seven hundred were from
the GDR.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en483en">^31^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en483}
Although the Soviets' inability to get the Iraqis and the Syrians to
cooperate sometimes drove them to distraction---Assad, especially, had a
tendency to get on Brezhnev's nerves---they patiently continued to
supply aid to both countries. Younger leaders gave some hope for the
future. Saddam Hussein was, according to the Hungarian Communists, a
"progressive, nationalist patriot" from whom much could be
expected.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en484en">^32^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en484} By
1980 Syria and Iraq were among the biggest recipients of Soviet backing
globally, although the amounts paled in comparison with US assistance to
Israel and Egypt.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-470}If Syria and Iraq were troubled alliances
for the Soviets, a revolution in the south of Arabia for a while, at
least, seemed to set hearts fluttering in Moscow. In 1967 Britain beat
another hasty retreat, this time from its colony in Aden, on the
southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. The National Liberation Front,
which took over power, declared their country to be a people's republic,
and sought close relations with the Soviets and their allies. The
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), as the country became
know, was different from the other "progressive" Arab regimes in
Communist eyes. The heads of the PDRY "are guided in their activity
mainly by Marxist-Leninist theory, rather than by nationalist and
religious views," declared the Hungarian leaders, who engaged in a big
assistance program for South
Yemen.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en485en">^33^</a>{#chapter017.xhtml#en485} For the
Soviets, access to the important port of Aden for naval purposes was
also a substantial advantage, just like its naval base in Tartus on the
Syrian coast.</p>
<p>Both the United States and the Soviet Union were looking for their own
kind of regimes in the Middle East and finding very few of them. The
Americans were finding democracy in Israel and the Soviets
Marxism-Leninism in South Yemen, but that helped them little as long as
both were small states actively engaged in antagonizing their neighbors.
From an overall strategic point of view, neither Superpower could hope
to achieve much, except in a negative sense. By the 1970s, both the
Soviets and the Americans needed, for their own reasons, to forestall
another Middle East war. Each hoped, gradually, to force the other power
out of the region, which would give them advantages in the global Cold
War (though not very many in the Middle East, as long as no fundamental
political and economic changes took place there). For both Superpowers,
the Middle East was a zone of confusion and fluidity, where lasting
advantages seemed very hard to achieve.</p>
<p>The lack of much economic progress, except in Israel and, through
extreme oil revenues, in some of the Gulf states, was more significant
for the future of the region than the shifting Cold War allegiances of
Middle Eastern states. Much as in other Third World countries, the
secular nationalist regimes in the Middle East failed to deliver the
kind of improvements in their daily lives that most people were looking
for. Instead they got increasingly high-handed and undemocratic
governments, in alliances with foreign powers to whom the lives of their
peoples seemed to count for little. Not surprisingly, some younger
people began looking for other forms of authority and purpose to
dedicate themselves to. Especially after the 1973 war, a sense of
hopelessness and humiliation drove thousands to attend Islamic schools
and mosques where preachers blamed the failures of Arab regimes on their
detachment from God.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-471}Contemporary political interpretations of
Islam were of course nothing new among Muslims in the Middle East or
elsewhere. But up to the mid-1970s such groups---the so-called
Islamists---were small and persecuted minorities. Even in Saudi Arabia,
where the king claimed to base his whole political system on Islam, only
government-approved Islamists were allowed. Egypt, Syria, and Iraq had
all banned the Muslim Brotherhood, and those who believed in a political
role for Muslim leaders disappeared into the regimes' prisons, or worse.
Gradually Islamists turned toward underground organization and
terrorism. In Syria the Ba'athists allegedly used chemical weapons among
other armaments to put down an Islamist rebellion in the west in 1982.
At least ten thousand people were killed.</p>
<p>But the pressure various Islamist organizations were put under by Middle
Eastern governments only seemed to strengthen them. Their faith, and the
belief that God was the ultimate authority of all things political, made
persecution easier to bear. Some groups, such as the Brotherhood in
Egypt, also began to extend their popularity through assistance programs
in poor neighborhoods. When those using such services were arrested by
the regime, they admitted that they would rather support Muslims who did
something for the poor than a regime that talked loudly but did very
little. The regimes were also vulnerable to criticism of corruption,
subservience to foreign powers, and their now famous inability to
destroy Israel.</p>
<p>Some key Islamist leaders made the Cold War the foremost sign of the
depravation of Middle Eastern regimes. Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian who had
traveled in the United States (where the way of life repelled him) and
who wrote extensively, mostly from prison, claimed that only Islam had
the answer to the world's ills.</p>

<p>Qutb was hanged in an Egyptian prison in 1966. But his ideas spread
further in the 1970s, as the secular states in the Middle East came
under pressure from within because of their poor economic performance.
The United States did not view the Islamists as a main threat. On the
contrary, the Islamists might be useful because they opposed Left-wing
nationalist regimes that the Americans themselves despised and wanted to
see removed. Their social conservatism and anti-Communism also fitted
American purposes. The arch-enemies of the Islamists were the Communist
parties, especially in Iraq and Iran. For the Soviets, the Islamists
were reactionary relics of the past. They would have no role in
progressive societies moving---under Soviet guidance---toward socialism.</p>
<p>By the late 1970s the Cold War in the Middle East had fashioned a region
with hard, almost intractable problems. The area was divided into US and
Soviet allies, much as were Europe and eastern Asia. Both powers
supported regimes that did not serve their own populations well. Neither
power had a real interest in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict, except
to the degree that negotiations helped their own position
[]{#chapter017.xhtml#page-473}versus the other Superpower. The United
States refused to speak with the Palestinian leaders, whom they
considered terrorists. The Soviets claimed to support the Palestinian
cause, but only to the extent that they could control the Palestinian
organizations. The American obsession with securing Middle Eastern oil
supplies made dictatorships such as Iran and Saudi Arabia natural US
allies. It was an explosive mix, which made sure that the region would
stay highly volatile up toward the end of the Cold War and beyond.

<p>By the mid-1970s it seemed as if the Cold War had become an entrenched
international system, although at significantly lower levels of tension
than before. Some people believed that détente would, over time, help
end the conflict, through social and economic convergence or through the
dismantling of iron curtains through trust building and human contact.
But even those who thought that the Cold War was there to stay claimed
that the conflict had been transformed. Instead of ever-higher global
tension, the world seemed headed for some form of duopoly, in which the
United States and the Soviet Union shared responsibility for limiting
regional conflicts, making sure that nuclear weapons did not
proliferate, and avoiding restlessness within their own ranks. Rivalry
would continue, even precarious rivalry as that in the Middle East. But
the Cold War was manageable and stable. Very few people believed that
Leonid Brezhnev or Gerald Ford ultimately would set the world on fire
because of their beliefs. Brezhnev, the <em>New York Times</em>' Moscow
correspondent reported in 1973, "has gained a reputation in the West for
his taste for food, drink, hunting and fast cars, and problems with
weight and smoking. A rising flow of Western visitors has found him
gregarious and talkative and has come away... struck by his warm
smile."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en487en">^1^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en487} A man, it
seemed, who enjoyed life so much that ideology was of less consequence.</p>
<p>There were of course dissidents to this ameliorated view of the Cold
War. In the Soviet Union and eastern Europe some people opposed the
authoritarian rule of Communist bosses. The Chinese, set on their own
course, cursed the prospect of a Soviet-US global condominium. The
Islamists condemned the rule of infidel powers that tried to prevent the
return of Muslims to God. In the United States neoconservatives raged
against the compromises with evil that the Nixon Administration had
carried out. America, they claimed, was selling its birthright for a
short period of peace with the enemy. The Soviet Union, claimed Ronald
Reagan in his race against Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination in
1976, had its sights set on global hegemony. It was for the United
States to resist it. "We did not seek world leadership," Reagan said,
"it was thrust upon us. It has been our destiny almost from the first
moment this land was settled. If we fail to keep our rendezvous with
destiny or, as John Winthrop said in 1630, 'Deal falsely with our God,'
we shall be made 'a story and byword throughout the world.' Americans
are hungry to feel once again a sense of mission and
greatness."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en488en">^2^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en488}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-476}Although the détente policies of Nixon and
Brezhnev had their enemies in various places, it is difficult to imagine
the collapse of détente without the changes in US politics that took
place between 1973 and 1976. The Watergate affair convinced many
Americans that there was something fundamentally wrong with the way the
country was governed. Nixon, Kissinger, and the secrecy with which the
agreements with the Soviet Union had been carried out were part of the
problem. Senator Henry Jackson, a Democrat from Washington State,
attacked the Administration for not realizing that the Soviet Union
consistently violated human rights and therefore could not be trusted in
international affairs. Détente was one of the many ways in which Nixon
and his successor had hoodwinked the American people, Jackson believed.
In 1974 Jackson and a majority in the Senate forced through an amendment
stipulating that the United States could not grant Most Favored Nation
status in trade to countries that had a bad human rights record. This
included the Soviet Union, which, however, was given an eighteen-month
waiver to improve its practices, including the right to emigrate. The
Soviets were furious, but Kissinger told them that the Administration
would overcome these problems.</p>
<p>In the election campaign of 1976 Ford came under increasing pressure
from fellow Republicans who wanted to repudiate détente. The problem
with Nixon's approach, they claimed, was that it made the United States
into just another country in the world. Ronald Reagan, the former
governor of California who ran against Ford for the nomination in 1976,
claimed on the campaign trail that</p>

:::</p>
<p>Reagan's rhetoric did not earn him his party's presidential nomination
in 1976. Ford was nominated, but then proceeded to lose the election to
the Democratic neophyte Jimmy Carter, in part because of the damage the
Republican Right had done to their own candidate. By the 1976 election,
the neoconservative coalition had become a force to be reckoned with in
American politics. They opposed domestic reforms to advantage women and
ethnic minorities and felt that the upheavals of the 1960s had made the
United States almost ungovernable. The country could therefore easily be
taken advantage of by the Soviets or by Third World states that attacked
America but were happy to receive US aid when needed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-478}This sense of being beleaguered from
without and abandoned by their own leaders was shared by many Americans,
even those who did not support Reagan in 1976. Economic growth was
sluggish and inflation higher than it had been for three decades,
reaching 13 percent toward the end of the decade. The Ford
Administration's critics started using the term "stagflation,"
symbolizing all that was wrong with the US economy. Although almost all
major economies experienced the same combination of low growth and high
inflation during the 1970s, critics of the US Administration presented
it as if it were a particular US phenomenon, and a telltale sign of
Washington's weakness vis-à-vis other countries. In reality, stagflation
was a product of free-floating currencies, globalization of capital and
investment, increasing raw material prices, and, over time, increasing
international competition. Gradually, these developments would actually
help the US economy recover faster than many others. But seen from the
mid-1970s, it all seemed to be doom and gloom. The price and wage
freezes that the Nixon Administration introduced did not help, either
with the economy or the public
mood.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en490en">^4^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en490}</p>
<p><strong>T[HE]{.small-caps} A[MERICAN SENSE]{.small-caps}</strong> of their country
being poorly led and taken advantage of was also advanced by real
developments in international affairs that made the United States look
wayward and weak. In Indochina, after a brief lull in the fighting after
the completion of the US withdrawal in 1973, the revolutionary armies
went on the offensive. Although both of North Vietnam's allies, the
Soviet Union and China, had urged caution, the North Vietnamese armies
started an all-out attack on South Vietnam in December 1974. The
guarantee of increases in Soviet supplies were of critical importance in
Hanoi's decision-making. For the Soviets, expanding support for North
Vietnam was not a break with the détente policy; indeed, as Brezhnev
pointed out repeatedly, Moscow had never promised to reduce its aid to
Vietnam. On the contrary, Soviet advisers in Hanoi increasingly agreed
with their Vietnamese hosts that the South was ripe for picking. The
Chinese also continued their assistance, in part to rival the Soviets.
No wonder Le Duan and the other Vietnamese Communist leaders saw 1975 as
a unique opportunity to reunify their country, one that might not come
back soon, especially given the increasing political dissonance between
them and leaders in Beijing.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-479}The North Vietnamese offensive was in
complete violation of the agreements that country had signed only a year
earlier. Although the South Vietnamese armies on paper seemed well
placed to defend their territory, the lack of coordination among their
military units, the massive refugee problem that the offensive created,
and the psychological blow of the US withdrawal combined to defeat South
Vietnam fast. Although the North Vietnamese were aware of their
strategic superiority, they were still surprised at how quickly
resistance folded. By March 1975 the South Vietnamese forces had been
driven out of the central highlands. Their enemies then proceeded to
swallow up the coastal cities and bases one by one. In April the North
Vietnamese leadership ordered all their forces to head straight for
Saigon.</p>
<p>South Vietnamese president Nguyen Van Thieu resigned 21 April, accusing
his former American backers of being "unfair... inhumane...
irresponsible." "You ran away and left us to do the job that you could
not do," Thieu
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en491en">^5^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en491} Congress
had already cut assistance for South Vietnam in half in 1974, and
further US aid in 1975 probably would not have made much of a difference
on the battlefield. South Vietnam's calls for the United States to live
up to Nixon's unofficial promises of military support in case of a
northern attack went unheeded in Washington. Just after Thieu's bitter
resignation, President Ford told university students that "America can
regain the sense of pride that existed before Vietnam. But it cannot be
achieved by refighting a war that is finished as far as America is
concerned.... The fate of responsible men and women everywhere, in the
final decision, rests in their own hands, not in
ours."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en492en">^6^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en492}</p>
<p>North Vietnamese forces, supported by the South Vietnamese National
Liberation Front, took Saigon 30 April 1975. Images of American
helicopters airlifting out US personnel and as many terrified South
Vietnamese officials as they could carry did no good for America's
standing in the world. Whatever way it was construed, the end of the
Vietnam wars was a defeat for American power in Asia. At home, critics
attacked the Administration for apathy and cowardice. And although their
claims that US Cold War policies had fallen from omnipotence to
impotence were certainly exaggerated, the flight from Saigon was
undoubtedly the nadir of US foreign policy in the postwar era.
Communists and Third World revolutionaries celebrated, as did many young
people in the United States and Europe who had opposed the war. But for
the two and a half million Americans who served in Vietnam, not to
mention for the families of the fifty thousand who died and the
seventy-five thousand who were left severely disabled, the fall of
Saigon left a bitterness toward their own political leaders that never
quite disappeared.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-480}For the majority of Vietnamese who
sympathized in one form or another with national liberation as outlined
by the Communists, Hanoi's victory proved a mixed blessing. Their
country was reunified and at peace. But the northern leaders took
complete control and left little to the southern Liberation Front. They
wanted a quick reunification in social and political terms as well as
militarily. The country was declared to be a Socialist Republic under
the leadership of the Communist Party. Their form of socialism was
distinctly Soviet. The economy was directed through centralized
planning. Private ownership was abolished and agriculture collectivized.
Trade and markets were all put under government
control.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en493en">^7^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en493} At least
a million people in the south---former military men, business people,
and teachers---were sent to reeducation camps. As a result, the southern
economy collapsed. Two million Vietnamese fled abroad, some out of fear
but most out of economic necessity.</p>
<p>If many Vietnamese had an unhappy time after 1975, conditions were ten
times worse across the border in Cambodia. There a fanatical group of
Communists, inspired by the more extreme forms of Maoism and China's
Cultural Revolution, took power after the US-supported regime collapsed.
Their leader, who called himself Pol Pot, believed that the combination
of imperialist influence and rapacious neighbors threatened the
Cambodian people with extinction. His was a form of Maoism that put
exceptional emphasis on autarky, racial purity, and eugenics. On taking
power, Pol Pot's Communist Party of Kampuchea (known by its French
sobriquet, Khmer Rouge) emptied the cities and drove everyone into the
countryside to engage in basic agricultural work. In spite of the
assistance they had received from Hanoi during the war, they turned
viciously on all national minorities in Cambodia, including the
Vietnamese and the Chinese who lived there. It is estimated that almost
two and half million people, a third of the population, died as a result
of Khmer Rouge
policies.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en494en">^8^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en494}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-481}It took time before Western public opinion
began to realize the enormity of what was happening in Cambodia. So
intense had the condemnation of the US war in Indochina been, that many
did not want to believe the full extent of the Khmer Rouge's genocides.
But when the gruesome facts began to be known, they contributed
significantly to the overall critique of Communism, not least in Europe.
Still, Cambodia did not dominate the news pages the way it should have,
in part because the events there were overshadowed by the crises in the
Middle East and the seeming implosion of the US system of government
after Watergate. And in the middle of all this, a revolution took place
in Portugal, the consequences of which had more of an impact on the Cold
War than even the end of the conflict in Indochina.</p>
<p>Portugal had been a fascist-style dictatorship since 1933. Running the
poorest country in Europe, the regime clung on to its colonies, which it
believed gave it status and a hope for economic expansion in the future.
Even after the other European states were forced to decolonize, Portugal
insisted on keeping its African possessions (Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe) as well as East
Timor in the Indonesian archipelago. The regime told its people, and the
United States and its NATO allies, that the liberation movements
fighting in these countries were Communists, directed by Moscow. But
patience with what seemed expensive, unwinnable colonial wars was
wearing thin among the population and in the military. The event that
broke the regime's back was the 1973 oil crisis. Portugal could simply
not afford to keep its population with subsidized gas as well as provide
for its forces fighting in Africa.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-482}On 25 April 1974 a group of younger
officers, all of whom had served overseas, acted against the regime. In
a bloodless coup, later called the Carnation Revolution, they removed
the government and set up a National Salvation Junta of leading generals
to rule the country. The colonies were promised independence. But
General António de Spínola and the moderates who headed the new
administration were soon confronted by some of the junior officers who
had put them in place. The younger men wanted more rapid change in
Portuguese society. Some of them allied themselves with the Portuguese
Communist Party, a pro-Moscow party that preached revolution without
much of a plan for taking power. Portugal went through a period of
continuous political instability, during which confrontations between
the Left and the Right made the country almost ungovernable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Portuguese colonies in Africa seceded one by one. In
Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde the transition was smooth. The united
liberation front took power and transformed itself into a Marxist
regime, closely linked to Cuba and the Soviet Union. The Front for the
Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) took power there and declared a
People's Republic. Though aligned with the Soviet bloc, its leaders
guarded their independence. In Angola, however, a civil war had been
underway between competing liberation movements even before the
Portuguese revolution. In 1974, as the Portuguese were preparing to
withdraw, this war became a conflagration that threatened to engulf
neighboring African countries as well as the Superpowers.</p>
<p>Angola was by far the richest of Portugal's former African colonies in
terms of resources. The population, however, was poor, and the
colonizers had done their best to stimulate rivalry among its main
ethnic groups. The only liberation movement that had support among all
groups, including the white and mixed-race elite in the capital, Luanda,
was the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The MPLA
was a front led by Marxist intellectuals with close connections to the
Portuguese Communist Party. It had received Soviet, Cuban, and Yugoslav
support since the early 1960s but had seen its fair share of infighting
and splits. Just after the Soviets had begun increasing their support
for the movement, in 1970, the MPLA went through one of its ruptures.
When the Carnation Revolution took place, the movement was therefore at
a disadvantage compared with its opponents, the National Front for the
Liberation of Angola (FNLA), a nativist group that was supported by
Zaire's president, Mobutu Sese Seko, and the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which drew most of its support
from the Ovimbundu tribe.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-483}When the Angolan civil war broke out among
these groups in 1974, the MPLA soon improved its position. It controlled
the capital and the areas around it, and it was able to work smoothly
with the Portuguese officers representing the new government in Lisbon.
By the summer of 1975 it dominated eleven out of fifteen Angolan
provinces. But the governments in Zaire and South Africa intervened,
with covert US support, sending troops into Angola to fight against the
MPLA. Neither wanted a Communist-led country on their borders. The
Soviets and the Cubans scrambled to get support in to their allies. When
the MPLA's leader Aghostino Neto declared his People's Republic of
Angola on 11 November 1975, the Cubans began airlifting troops and
weapons to Luanda.</p>
<p>The South Africans almost reached the Angolan capital before the Cubans
counterattacked. But helped by the Soviets who supplied aircraft and
artillery, the Cuban and MPLA response was decisive. The South Africans
withdrew southward, feeling betrayed by the United States. There,
Congress had prohibited further military support for the Angolan
opposition, in spite of White House protests. By spring 1976 the MPLA
was in control of the country, supported by almost thirty thousand
Cubans and an increasing number of Soviet and eastern European advisers.
The Ford Administration was incensed. They saw Angola as a new form of
Soviet intervention, carried out across thousands of miles, with the
Cubans as proxies. "It is an awful situation," Kissinger told the South
African ambassador, "and ultimately the Russians will be able to ride
the momentum of the victory in Angola to defeat the powerful leaders in
Africa, resulting in total victory in Africa.... The American people in
certain situations become divided, like with Vietnam, and then there
will be no action taken by them. We therefore cannot count on
them."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en495en">^9^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en495}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-484}The Americans were right in seeing Angola
as a new form of Soviet intervention, although in Moscow it had happened
almost as an afterthought. The Cubans had been the driving force, not
the Soviets.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en496en">^10^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en496} The
Angolan intervention, Karen Brutents, the deputy head of the CPSU's
International Department, explained later, "became a fact without any
master plan."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en497en">^11^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en497}
The main point from Moscow's perspective was the need to back up the
Cubans, and not let them down "a second time," as Brutents
said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en498en">^12^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en498} The Cuban
missile crisis still rankled in Moscow, as did the 1973 October War.
Even though Brezhnev was skeptical to begin with about putting too much
emphasis on Angola, the Cuban and MPLA success on the ground made him
and many in Moscow feel that this was "payback time." The United States
had intervened globally for a generation or more. Now the Soviets had
shown that they could do so, too, in support of their strategic and
ideological interests.</p>
<p>Along with the fall of Indochina, the intervention in Angola helped the
powerful backlash against détente already underway in Washington.
President Ford, running for the presidency, banned the use of the term
"détente" in his campaign. His opponent, the Democratic governor Jimmy
Carter, who had no foreign policy experience, castigated the
Administration's policies. "We've become fearful to compete with the
Soviet Union on an equal basis," Carter claimed in the televised debates
with Ford. "We talk about détente. The Soviet Union knows what they want
in détente, and they've been getting it. We have not known what we've
wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every
instance."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en499en">^13^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en499}
Carter wanted to do away with the secrecy of the Kissinger years. He
wanted the United States to emphasize its own values in foreign affairs:
human rights, freedom of religion and emigration, self-determination.
American principles, not "balance of power politics," would restore the
respect the United States had lost in the world, Carter believed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-485}Jimmy Carter won a close election in 1976.
From the beginning of his presidency, he sought to set relations with
the Soviet Union on what he considered a safer ground. In his first
letters to Brezhnev, Carter expressed a wish to move beyond the Cold
War. There was, the US president said, much that the two countries could
cooperate on: "development, better nutrition, and a more meaningful life
for the less fortunate portions of
mankind."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en500en">^14^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en500} As to
the SALT negotiations, Carter felt they did not go far enough. He
preferred, he told Brezhnev, deep cuts in nuclear arsenals on both
sides. Carter's new proposals horrified the Soviets. They believed basic
agreement had already been reached on a new SALT treaty. And they were
fearful that the new proposals were a ruse. They knew full well that
Soviet nuclear missiles were much less accurate in targeting than US
missiles. Having a lot of missiles therefore made the Soviets feel
safer. Brezhnev was angry with Carter's moving away from the status quo,
as he saw it. Carter's secretary of state, the experienced diplomat
Cyrus Vance, recalled that when he tried to bring up the issue in
Moscow, he "got a wet rag in the face and was told to go
home."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en501en">^15^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en501}</p>
<p>But things were going to get much worse between Carter and the Soviets.
In order to emphasize his human rights policy, the new president chose
to send a message to the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, in which he
underlined his "firm commitment to promote respect for human rights not
only in our own country but also abroad. We shall use our good offices,"
Carter said, "to seek the release of prisoners of
conscience."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en502en">^16^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en502} The
Kremlin was livid. It was an "an attempt to harass us, to embarrass us,"
their US ambassador Anatolii Dobrynin said
later.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en503en">^17^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en503} All
preparations for an early meeting between the two presidents were put on
hold by Moscow.</p>
<p>Some of the early problems in Carter's Soviet policy came out of
inexperience. Nobody in Carter's inner team of advisers had any
background on foreign affairs or, worse, on thinking about foreign
affairs in terms of domestic politics. The growing power and influence
of the US Jewish lobby seems, for instance, to have taken the new
Administration by surprise. "It is something that was not a part of our
Georgia and Southern political experience and consequently not well
understood," Carter's chief of staff admitted to the Georgia-born
president.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en504en">^18^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en504} Both
in his Soviet and his Middle East policy, Carter quickly learned that he
needed allies from special interest groups, but he was not always good
at winning them over.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-486}Carter's difficulties grew because from
day one of his Administration he was getting conflicting advice from his
key foreign policy aides. Cyrus Vance believed that a lot had been
achieved through détente and that Carter had to be very careful not to
throw it away for little gain. An old-school diplomat, the secretary of
state presumed that antagonizing the Soviets unless absolutely necessary
would not be in America's interest. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Harvard
professor who became Carter's national security adviser, had a different
view and temperament. Of Polish origin, Brzezinski was closer to the
president's conviction that the Soviet Union, like any other country,
had to be confronted when it behaved in ways that were contrary to the
international norms that the United States was promoting. Brzezinski
encouraged what he deemed a tough, realistic foreign policy because, as
he explained to Carter, the Soviet Union needed détente even more than
the United States did.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the Carter Administration was under pressure
from a growing public opinion at home that thought the Soviet Union was
taking advantage of America's weakness. Although a majority was still in
favor of arms limitation talks with the Soviets, almost 70 percent of
Americans in 1978 thought that the Soviet Union could not be trusted to
live up to its
agreements.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en505en">^19^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en505} In
many ways the fear and distrust of the Soviet Union was a reflection of
the worries many Americans had about conflict, decline, and
powerlessness in their own society. But it took activist groups to give
voice to these frustrations. One such group, the Committee on the
Present Danger (CPD), included both Republicans and Democrats who
believed that the Soviet Union was on the offensive worldwide. Led by
Paul Nitze, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and President Johnson's former
undersecretary of state Eugene Rostow, the CPD became a powerful
lobbying group critical of the SALT negotiations and Soviet human rights
violations, and supportive of increased military expenditure and links
with Israel.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-487}Carter had hoped to spend time dealing
with the broader issues on his foreign policy agenda, first and foremost
US energy security, peace in the Middle East, and human rights on a
global scale. Instead, with his ratings slipping in the polls, he was
forced back to national security issues dealing with the Soviet Union.
With SALT negotiations near a standstill, the Soviets, on their side,
were losing hope that much could be achieved under this president. This
realization, in turn, provided incentive for those in Moscow who wanted
a more assertive Soviet policy, especially with regard to Africa and
Asia. The world, some of them claimed, was turning toward socialism, and
the USSR had to be there to help the process.</p>
<p>Seen from a Soviet perspective, the global situation in the mid-1970s
could indeed seem hopeful. There had been setbacks in the Middle East,
but these, it was explained to Brezhnev, were because of imperialist
perfidy, not because of the class-struggle in Arab countries. Syria and
Iraq were working more closely with the Soviets. South Yemen was a
People's Republic. All the freshly independent African countries were
governed by Marxist-Leninists. Vietnam was reunified under Communist
rule. India had become a Soviet ally. In Somalia, across from Yemen on
the Horn of Africa, the Revolutionary Socialist Party held power and
invited the Soviet navy to station ships at the port of Berbera.
Internationally things looked good for the Soviet Union. For some
younger Communists there, these global advances made up for an
increasing disillusionment with the practice of socialism in the Soviet
Union itself.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian revolution had its origin in the changes that were
sweeping all of Africa in the 1970s. Younger leaders, especially in the
military, were impatient with the lack of social and economic progress
and frustrated by their own lack of status. For some of these,
Soviet-style Marxism-Leninism was more attractive than vaguer forms of
African socialism. Cuba was a great inspiration, both as a multiracial
society and as a planned economy. The idea of forcing through necessary
social change rapidly and efficiently was inspiring for these leaders.
Ethiopia, which had been an orthodox Christian monarchy for centuries,
with little social and economic change, seemed to them to be ripe for
such a reshaping.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-488}Ethiopia's 1974 revolution overthrew the
emperor Haile Selassie and replaced him with a group of younger officers
who called themselves the Dergue, or Committee. The aging emperor was
murdered in prison a year later and buried beneath the latrines in his
former palace. Mengistu Haile Mariam, a thirty-seven-year-old major,
made himself the leader of the new government. He sought close relations
with the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and Cuba. Moscow was
unenthusiastic to begin with. The Soviet leaders doubted the Ethiopians'
dedication to Marxism-Leninism and feared that too-close links with
Ethiopia would create problems for their existing alliance with
neighboring Somalia, with whom the Dergue was increasingly at odds. By
1977, however, the Soviets had begun to supply weapons and military
training to the Ethiopians, and the Cubans were sending advisers.</p>
<p>Concerned by the increasing closeness between Addis Ababa and Moscow,
the Somalians decided to act. They wanted to unite Ogaden, a mainly
Somali region in southern Ethiopia, with their own country, and thought
the chaos created by the Ethiopian revolution would give them the chance
to do so. The Soviets and the Cubans warned Somalian president Siad
Barre against such an attack and hoped to mediate a solution. But by
July 1977 it was clear that Ethiopia was facing an all-out Somalian
invasion.</p>
<p>The Soviets decided to help save the Ethiopian revolution. They broke
off relations with Siad Barre and began freighting advanced weapons to
Addis Ababa by an air-bridge, the biggest such operation since the 1973
assistance to Egypt. At least fifteen thousand Cuban soldiers arrived,
and Soviet officers were commanding Ethiopian and Cuban troops. The
Somalians resisted fiercely, but by early 1978 they were being driven
back across the border. Meanwhile, the Soviet relationship with Ethiopia
widened into support for all parts of the Ethiopian government. Some
Soviet leaders, especially in the International Department of the
Communist Party, believed that Ethiopia could become a showcase for
Soviet-inspired modernization in the Third World. Although they had
misgivings about Mengistu's brutality and his constant warfare against
minority groups, the head of the International Department, Boris
Ponomarev, agreed to send "a group of experienced comrades of the CPSU"
to help build the Dergue into a Communist Party in the
future.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en506en">^20^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en506}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-489}As could be expected, the Soviet
involvement in the Horn of Africa set off alarm bells in Washington.
Brzezinski told the president that he saw a pattern of behavior on the
Soviet side that pushed in the direction of more aggression worldwide.
Carter agreed. Even though he was eager to move forward in bilateral
relations with the Soviet Union, he worried about Soviet behavior in the
Third World. The president believed that détente included principles of
nonintervention in regional conflicts. "The Soviets' violating of these
principles," he told the press, "would be a cause of concern to me,
would lessen the confidence of the American people in the word and
peaceful intentions of the Soviet Union, would make it more difficult to
ratify a SALT agreement or comprehensive test ban agreement if
concluded, and therefore, the two are linked because of actions by the
Soviets. We don't initiate the
linkage."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en507en">^21^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en507}</p>
<p>The Horn of Africa crisis highlighted the conflicts within Carter's own
Administration. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance simply could not
understand why Brzezinski and the president threatened to let the Horn
overshadow other developments that were much more important to the
United States. Linking Soviet interventions and SALT would be
disastrous, Vance told them. "We will end up losing SALT and that will
be the worst thing that could happen. If we do not get a SALT treaty in
the President's first four years, that will be a blemish on his record
forever."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en508en">^22^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en508} But
Vance's voice counted for less and less in the Administration.</p>
<p>One way in which the United States could pay the Soviets back for their
perceived Third World activism was through improving relations with
China. Carter at first wanted to go slow with the issue of full
recognition of the People's Republic. He was concerned about the Chinese
Communists' human rights record and understood that working more closely
with the Chinese would be a red rag to Brezhnev. The new Chinese leaders
who came to power after Mao Zedong's death in 1976 were keen to extend
their contacts with the Americans. While Mao had thought of links with
the United States first and foremost in terms of security for China, his
successor, Deng Xiaoping, wanted US technology and trade. Deng needed US
help to make China rich and strong. A more extensive relationship with
the United States would assist in China's modernization, Deng concluded.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-490}After Ethiopia, US preparations for a full
recognition of the People's Republic of China moved into high gear. Even
though recognition did not change much in practical terms between the
two countries, it was a powerful symbolic act and it opened new
possibilities. Deng told his closest advisers that he wanted to
dramatically expand cooperation with the Americans, if they were willing
to reciprocate. The Chinese leader feared the massive strengthening of
Soviet power that he saw on a global scale. He was particularly
preoccupied with the increasing closeness of the Soviet-Vietnamese
relationship, and suspected it was part of a Soviet master plan for
surrounding China.</p>
<p>Relations between Vietnam and China had been in free fall since 1975. To
the astonishment of US leaders who had fought their war in Vietnam to a
large extent to contain Chinese Communist expansionism, this falling out
got increasingly militarized. By 1978 the two sides were trading insults
and sending troops to their border. Then, in what must have been the
most harebrained strategic plan of the century, the Khmer Rouge regime
in Cambodia followed up the expulsion of people of Vietnamese ancestry
with military incursions into Vietnam. The Vietnamese military, ten
times stronger, fought back. As their forces penetrated into Cambodia,
they were horrified by the levels of Khmer Rouge violence against its
own people. By the end of 1978 the leadership in Hanoi had decided to
remove Pol Pot's regime, both because it was a security threat to
Vietnam and because of its genocidal policies. In just two weeks the war
was over. The remnants of the Khmer Rouge fled to the borders with
Thailand, and a new pro-Vietnam regime was put in place in Cambodia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-491}Though it had acted for its own reasons,
Vietnam had saved Cambodia from one of the most murderous regimes in the
twentieth century. Deng Xiaoping, however, was furious. The Khmer Rouge
had been China's allies, of a sort, and Deng was convinced the Soviets
were behind the Vietnamese invasion. He decided, in his own words, to
teach Vietnam "an appropriate limited
lesson."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en509en">^23^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en509} On the
US side, Zbigniew Brzezinski also worried that if Vietnam got away with
its occupation of Cambodia, then it could also attack other countries.
It was, in a sense, a revival of domino theories, only this time China
and the United States were on the same side, and Vietnam was to be
punished for having removed a murderous Maoist dictatorship.</p>
<p>When Deng Xiaoping came to Washington to inaugurate the new relationship
with the United States in January 1979, the Chinese leader
straightforwardly informed his hosts that China would attack Vietnam to
teach it a lesson. It would be a limited attack with limited objectives,
and China would withdraw before the Soviet Union could act in the north.
Commenting on the overall situation with regard to the Soviets, Deng
said that he saw "no possibility of détente. We can say that the
situation is becoming more tense year by year.... We believe the Soviet
Union will launch a war. But if we act well and properly, it is possible
to postpone it. China hopes to postpone a war for twenty-two
years."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en510en">^24^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en510}</p>
<p>President Carter could not condone an outright Chinese attack on
Vietnam. But he also told Deng that he understood that China "cannot
allow Vietnam to pursue aggression with
impunity."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en511en">^25^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en511} The
United States ended up publicly deploring China's attack the following
month, but in private Carter shared intelligence with the Chinese and
assured them that the United States would back them up if the Soviets
threatened them from the north. The Chinese invasion turned out to be a
disaster for Beijing, however. Over the course of a month of fighting,
China lost almost half as many soldiers as the United States did in all
of its war in Vietnam. There is little doubt that if Deng had not
decided that the "lesson" for Vietnam was complete, the Chinese losses
would have increased even further. China's war in Vietnam not only
showed how woefully unprepared for actual fighting the People's
Liberation Army was. It also set Sino-Vietnamese relations on a course
of intense hostility that has lasted ever since.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-492}With tension mounting both in Washington
and Moscow, negotiators were still able to finish a SALT II agreement
that both sides would sign. In June 1979 Carter and Brezhnev traveled to
Vienna for the signing ceremony and the first summit in almost five
years. Their meetings did not work well. Brezhnev, aging, tired,
emotional, was deeply suspicious of Carter's commitment to détente. "It
had not been a simple thing to start restructuring Soviet-American
relations which had been burdened by the inertia of the Cold War,"
Brezhnev said at their first
meeting.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en512en">^26^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en512} He
accused the Americans of neglecting the principles of détente, as he saw
them: "complete equality, equal security, respect for each other's
legitimate interests, and non-interference in each other's affairs."
Carter responded that it was equally important that "we exercise
restraint in regional political competition, that we restrict our
military intervention in trouble spots in the world, either directly or
by proxy. It was important that we take care not to deprive either of
our countries or, for that matter, any other country, of access to
crucial natural
resources."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en513en">^27^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en513} SALT
II was signed, but---perhaps not surprisingly, given the public mood in
the United States---the US Senate held up ratification.</p>
<p>Carter's reference to natural resources signaled his increasing
preoccupation with political turbulence in the Middle East. Egypt's
president, Anwar Sadat, had broken with the other Arab countries in
November 1977 and traveled to Israel to begin direct negotiations with
Prime Minister Begin. This brave act made Egypt an outcast in the Arab
world, but it also secured US assistance in negotiating a separate peace
accord with Israel. Egypt got the Sinai peninsula back. It also got
massive increases in US assistance after the accords were signed at Camp
David in March 1979. But by then another Middle East country, Iran, was
ablaze with revolt. The Shah, in power since the US-sponsored coup that
overthrew Mossadegh in 1953, had been facing massive demonstrations
against his autocratic regime. In September 1978 he had declared martial
law. But with even the support of the Iranian army in doubt, the Shah
had fled the country in January 1979.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-493}The Iranian revolution led to another
massive increase in oil prices. The Americans worried that the powerful
Iranian Communist Party, the Tudeh, would take power in the chaos that
followed the Shah's departure. But instead Shia Islamist organizations
were in the driver's seat. Their focal point was Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, a seventy-seven-year-old Shia cleric who believed that Iran
should be made into an Islamic republic under his charismatic
leadership. Khomeini saw himself as the guardian of Islam in Iran. In
his sermons, spread illegally in Iran through audio and videotape, he
condemned both the United States and the Soviet Union as devils who were
out to destroy all Muslims. Khomeini's slogan was "neither Left, nor
Right, but Islam!" His triumphant return to Tehran from exile in
February 1979 immediately made him the country's de facto leader.</p>
<p>The Islamic revolution in Iran was a deliberate attempt at breaking with
the Cold War order. Khomeini appealed to all Muslims to help defend the
new regime: "We have turned our backs on East and West, on the Soviet
Union and America, in order to run our country ourselves," Khomeini
declared. "The position we have attained is a historical exception,
given the current conditions in the world, but our goal will certainly
not be lost if we are to die, martyred and
defeated."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en514en">^28^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en514} To
begin with, neither Washington nor Moscow thought that Khomeini's regime
would last. Many, in both capitals, thought that he would do like Muslim
conservatives in the past and eventually turn to the United States for
support. But they were wrong. Khomeini saw himself as the real
revolutionary against a world of falseness. In November 1979 some of his
supporters occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took its diplomats
hostage. Khomeini supported the occupation, in part to make sure that
any reconciliation with Carter would be as difficult as possible.</p>
<p>The hostage crisis undid Carter's presidency. He was seen as weak and
indecisive because he did not respond by attacking Iranian territory or
forcing some kind of showdown with Ayatollah Khomeini, as if that would
have helped the hostages. Instead, Carter struggled to understand what
was going on in Iran. He did not want to drive the Iranians into the
arms of the Soviets. The Cold War was still uppermost in his mind. In
the end he settled on a military rescue operation, which failed
spectacularly when two US aircraft collided in the Iranian desert. The
botched effort in April 1980 led to Vance's resignation as secretary of
state and probably doomed Carter's chances for reelection. A month later
Ronald Reagan, vowing to break with détente and make America great
again, won the Republican nomination for president.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-494}But if the Americans had trouble with
Islamism in Iran, the Soviets faced such trouble of their own farther
north. In Afghanistan a Marxist party had come to power through a
military coup in April 1978. The new regime started to work closely with
the Soviets, who advised them to go slow on implementing substantial
reform in the countryside. The Soviet advisers believed that the Afghan
people were not ready for large-scale secular initiatives such as land
reform, education for women, and outlawing child marriages. But the
Afghan Communists persisted. By early 1979 they faced a growing Islamist
rebellion, organized from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. The Afghan
Islamists believed in an Islamic revolution, like what had happened in
Iran (even though they regarded the Shia as sectarians). They were
mostly educated in the Middle East, in Egypt or Saudi Arabia, and they
wanted to shake up Afghan society as much as the Communists did---though
in the direction of <em>more</em> Islam, not less.</p>
<p>As Islamist attacks against government installations in Afghanistan
intensified, more Soviet advisers arrived to help the Afghan Communists
out. Even though the political haste of Mohammad Taraki, the Afghan
president, exasperated the Soviets, they were committed to supporting
the regime. They saw opportunity as well as danger. "Angola, in
combination with Ethiopia, was the way to Afghanistan," Karen Brutents,
the deputy head of the CPSU's International Department, observed
later.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en515en">^29^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en515} But when
Taraki himself was killed in factional infighting with his deputy,
Hafizullah Amin, in September 1979, Soviet advisers on the spot sounded
the alarm. Amin claimed to pursue an even more extreme Marxist-Leninist
policy than Taraki, but the KGB suspected him of contacts with the
Americans and of planning to "do a Sadat" on the Soviet Union. With
Islamist guerrillas advancing, the Soviets began preparing to remove
Amin by force and put in place a new Afghan Communist leadership more
loyal to the Soviet Union and more effective in fighting the Islamist
rebellion.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-495}The Soviet intervention began on Christmas
Eve 1979. The Carter Administration had been able to follow the troop
buildup on the Soviet side of the border through its new spy satellites,
so the invasion came as no surprise. The president was still horrified
at the Soviet action. Brzezinski had been describing to him what he
called an "arc of crisis," in which the Soviets were hoping to insert
their power, stretching from the Horn of Africa, across the Red Sea, to
the shores of the Indian Ocean. The Afghanistan invasion seemed to prove
such Soviet intentions. Some US analysts believed that the real
objectives of the Red Army operation were ports on the Indian Ocean and
control of the Gulf's oil. However far-fetched such suggestions were,
they had an effect in the frenzied White House atmosphere during the
hostage crisis.</p>
<p>Carter addressed the American people in a television address on the
evening of 4 January 1980. He called the Soviet invasion "an extremely
serious threat to peace." The reason for this, he said, was not just the
events in Afghanistan themselves. It was</p>
<p>::: blockquote
because of the threat of further Soviet expansion into neighboring
countries in Southwest Asia and also because such an aggressive military
policy is unsettling to other peoples throughout the world. This is a
callous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.
It is a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to
subjugate an independent Islamic people. We must recognize the strategic
importance of Afghanistan to stability and peace. A Soviet-occupied
Afghanistan threatens both Iran and Pakistan and is a steppingstone to
possible control over much of the world's oil
supplies.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en516en">^30^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en516}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-496}Two weeks later, in his state of the union
address, Carter underlined that "the implications of the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the
Second World
War."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en517en">^31^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en517} The
president asked his advisers for actions that could be taken to punish
the Soviets, and when proposals came in, he signed off on every one of
them, so that even Brzezinski was taken aback at the president's fury.
He stopped trade and cultural exchanges, barred exports of grain,
technology, and transport equipment, halted space cooperation, banned
Soviet fishing boats in US waters, and threatened to boycott the Moscow
Olympics. He also withdrew the SALT II treaty from consideration in the
Senate. "History," Carter said, "teaches... very few clear lessons. But
surely one such lesson learned by the world at great cost is that
aggression, unopposed, becomes a contagious
disease."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en518en">^32^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en518}</p>
<p>If it were not for previous events, starting with the Soviet Angola
operation in 1975, Carter's reaction could have been seen as exaggerated
and hyperbolic. The Soviet Union had had broad influence in Afghanistan
for two generations, and the Afghan Islamists, whom the United States
had started supporting even before the Soviet invasion, were not
necessarily a better alternative for Afghanistan than Communist rule.
But none of that mattered within the overall Cold War framework that
Carter applied. Ever since he became president, he had suspected that
the Soviets were mounting an outright challenge to the US position in
the world. By the time of the Ethiopian crisis, détente, from the US
perspective, had already been in deep trouble. US military expenditure,
in decline since the beginning of détente, had started to rise again. In
Carter's fourth budget it rose by almost 12 percent adjusted for
inflation, an increase unprecedented in
peacetime.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en519en">^33^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en519}
Zbigniew Brzezinski's summing up in his memoirs, that "détente lies
buried in the sands of the Ogaden," might seem outrageous, especially to
those who have visited that bleak part of the world. But in describing
President Carter's view at the time it may hold more than a grain of
truth.</p>
<p>And still Carter's emphasis on the Cold War did him so little good in US
political terms. In the presidential election he got clobbered by Ronald
Reagan, who claimed that inflation, the rise of Soviet power, and the
oil shocks all were due to the president's incompetence. But worse,
Reagan insisted, Carter did not really believe in America.</p>

:::</p>
<p>Reagan's rhetoric was a throwback to an earlier time, but for many
Americans it captured the moment perfectly. They wanted to be brought
back to a world of more certainty and away from foreign and domestic
challenges that were transforming the country they lived in. Never mind
that Reagan had very few concrete solutions to offer for America's ills.
Like Margaret Thatcher in Britain, he stood for a kind of conservative
rebellion against those, he claimed, who had been holding the country
back. In that sense Reagan's first cabinet was the most radical American
Administration since the New Deal. It promised to dramatically lower
taxes, eliminate the public deficit, abolish all price controls, and do
away with most government regulations of the economy. Both his
supporters and his opponents spoke of the Reagan Revolution, although in
reality much less happened than had been promised.</p>
<p>Reagan from the very beginning of his presidency believed that the
United States had to strengthen its defense and its international
prestige in order to negotiate with the Soviet Union from an
advantageous position. Supremely self-confident, he thought that he
would succeed where, in his view, Nixon, Ford, and Carter had failed. He
did not take into consideration the effect his rhetoric had on the other
side. Reagan's tough talk really frightened the aging leadership in
Moscow, who, for the first time, started believing that the world might
be heading toward a total war between the Superpowers. When Reagan said,
at the start of his presidency, that Americans should "begin planning
for a world where our adversaries are remembered only for their role in
a sad and rather bizarre chapter in human history," Soviet leaders took
him very
seriously.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en521en">^35^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en521}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-498}Part of the reason for the Soviet fear of
Reagan's policies was their own failure in Afghanistan. Instead of a
short intervention that would set things right in that country, as he
had been promised by his advisers, Brezhnev got a long and deepening
war. The brutality of Soviet warfare created a massive refugee problem,
which the Islamists could make use of to get adherents for their cause.
The Soviet problems widened in 1982 and '83, when Reagan stepped up the
support for the Afghan Islamists, the mujahedin, and their backers in
Pakistan. Although the Reagan Administration was aware that some of
these Islamists were at least as anti-American as they were anti-Soviet,
they had concluded that assisting them was essential in pushing back
Soviet power. "Here is the beauty of the Afghan operation," said William
Casey, Reagan's head of the CIA, to his colleagues. "Usually it looks
like the big bad Americans are beating up on the natives. Afghanistan is
just the reverse. The Russians are beating up on the little guys. We
don't make it our war. The mujahedin have all the motivation they need.
All we have to do is to give them help, only more of
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en522en">^36^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en522}</p>
<p>Afghanistan was not the only place where Reagan wanted to push back
against Left-wing revolutions. In Nicaragua, one of Latin America's
poorest countries, a group of Marxist-inspired rebels had taken power in
1979 after ousting a deeply unpopular dictator who had been supported by
the United States. The Sandinista Front, as Nicaragua's new leaders
called themselves, had a radical program of nationalizations and land
reform. They wanted close relations with Cuba and the Soviet bloc, even
though Fidel Castro warned them against moving so fast that the United
States would
intervene.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en523en">^37^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en523} The
Sandinistas tried to avoid a direct confrontation with Washington, but
the Reagan Administration had them in their gun sights from the moment
they took office. Reagan's point of attack was the Nicaraguan support
for a rebel movement in neighboring El Salvador. The president claimed
that he had evidence of the involvement of "the Soviet Union, of Cuba,
of the PLO, of, even Qadhafi in Libya, and others in the Communist bloc
nations to bring about this terrorism down
there."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en524en">^38^</a>{#chapter018.xhtml#en524} But his
main culprits were the Sandinistas.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-499}By late 1981 the United States had helped
organize a counterrevolutionary force in Nicaragua, the so-called
Contras, and was beginning to supply them with weapons and training. The
immediate aim was to put pressure on the Sandinista government to stop
its involvement in El Salvador, but soon the goal shifted to the
overthrow of the Nicaraguan government itself. The Sandinistas were
helped by revolutionary volunteers from the rest of Latin America, by
the Cubans, and, to a very limited extent, by the Soviets. Though not
all Sandinista reforms were equally popular with the Nicaraguans, most
of the population seems to have believed, at least to begin with, that
their new leadership was standing up to US bullying. The underlying
reason for the support of the Left in Central America was of course the
immense poverty that most people lived under. More than half of all
Nicaraguan children were malnourished in the 1970s. The contrast with
life a few hundred miles farther north was striking. In a world where
the average person in Central America consumed less meat than what the
average American fed to his pet, protesting social injustice easily
became a protest against US hegemony.</p>
<p>Détente was defeated by a number of circumstances, some of which were
outside of Superpower control. Revolutions in the Third World unsettled
the process of rapprochement, and rapid economic change helped undermine
it. It is also clear that from the very beginning, leaders in the United
States and the USSR had read somewhat different things into détente. The
Soviets believed that they had got acceptance for true equality between
the two powers. Most leaders in the United States thought that the
Soviets had signed up to cooperate with a world-system that was led by
the Americans. But the Soviets were also consciously willing to take
great risks in their relations with Washington for the sake of assisting
revolutions elsewhere and expanding their own power.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter018.xhtml#page-500}Ultimately, though, détente was defeated
by politics in the United States. Nixon and Kissinger had gone further
in attempting to manage the Cold War together with the Soviet Union than
most Americans were willing to accept. After Watergate the American
distrust of its government, <em>all</em> government, reached fever pitch.
Détente was a victim of this process, although it seems likely that
rapprochement would have come to a standstill at some point even without
Nixon's disgrace. Most Americans were simply not willing to tolerate
that the United States could have an equal in international affairs, in
the 1970s or ever. And they elected Ronald Reagan president to make sure
that such a devaluation of the American purpose would not happen again.

<p>By 1982 many people were saying that the Cold War had returned to where
it had been before the détente process began. Some were even arguing
that Reagan had started a "new Cold War," as if the conflict had ever
gone away completely. But even for those who had observed the fighting
of the Cold War in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and south and
southeast Asia in the 1970s, the conflict in the 1980s seemed to take on
a new and more dangerous dimension. There was the relentless military
buildup, which had taken a new and hazardous turn. The threat of nuclear
war was ever more immediate, especially as both sides were developing
new, lighter, and more easily targetable weapons. And there was the
rhetoric, which by 1982--83 had reached fever pitch. Reagan spoke of the
USSR as "the focus of evil in the modern world." The Soviets spoke of
Reagan as the new Hitler. "Reagan's vulgar speeches show the true face
of the military-industrial complex. They have long sought such a figure.
Now, they have finally found it in the form of Reagan," said Iurii
Andropov, who after Brezhnev's death in 1982 replaced him as Soviet
leader.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en525en">^1^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en525}</p>
<p>The Cold War in the early 1980s was very perilous, probably more so than
at any other time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. But there were
other trends as well. China began to move away from the
hypercentralization of economic power that had been its ideal under Mao.
Some countries that had identified themselves as belonging to the Third
World began experimenting with reforms that opened them to market
practices both domestically and internationally. But first and foremost
there was the beginning transformation of Europe, where western European
integration and economic expansion increasingly created an irresistible
attraction for countries east of the Iron Curtain. So strong was the
pull that even the reinvigorated Superpower Cold War could not entirely
deter it, especially since one Superpower---the USSR---was no longer
altogether certain what its aims in Europe truly were.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-502}<strong>L[IKE THE
INTENSIFICATION]{.small-caps}</strong> of the Superpower conflict, the
transformation of the Cold War in Europe can be traced back to the
Portuguese revolution of 1974. For Europeans, much less preoccupied with
events in Africa than the Superpowers were, the issue was not so much
the character of the regimes in Luanda or Maputo. It was what would come
out of the change of government in Lisbon. While most western Europeans
celebrated Portugal's turn away from a Fascist-style dictatorship, they
also worried about the effect a Communist takeover outside the Soviet
zone could have on the continent's future. The issue was not so much
about the Portuguese Left overall. It was mainly about the resurgent
Portuguese Communist Party, which went out of its way to proclaim its
support for the USSR and its ideals at a time when patience with these
ideals ran thin outside of the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>The Portuguese revolution happened at a time when significant parts of
the western European radical Left had begun to feel that the legacy of
the Russian October Revolution was becoming less and less relevant for
their own political practice. The so-called New Left of the 1960s had of
course proclaimed this already, but their reach was limited. When the
Italian Communist Party (PCI), followed by the Spanish and the French,
in the late 1960s began saying that they believed in a transition to
socialism only through elections and parliaments, the effect was much
greater. But the new PCI leader, the charismatic and vigorous Enrico
Berlinguer, did not stop there. Berlinguer wanted to re-create western
European Communism as a democratic alternative in the West. He also
wanted to put pressure on the eastern European parties to reform and
respect human and democratic rights. Especially after the Chilean coup
in 1973, in which the Left had been destroyed, Berlinguer argued for a
"historic compromise" between Catholic and Communist parties in Europe
to safeguard democracy. His Eurocommunism proved popular in Italy and
beyond.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-503}On a European level, the Portuguese
revolution pitted Berlinguer's Eurocommunists against Soviet support for
the doctrinaire Portuguese Communist Party. Privately, to other
like-minded Communists and Social Democrats, including West Germany's
Brandt and Sweden's Olof Palme, Berlinguer admitted that it would be a
disaster for the Left in Europe if the Portuguese Communists came to
power. In a sure sign of how western European politics was shifting, the
opposition to Communist rule in Portugal brought together some strange
bedfellows: Eurocommunists, Social Democrats, Catholic groups, and the
CIA all in different ways attempted to strengthen the non-Communist
alternatives. When the Portuguese Socialists under Mario Soares came to
power in 1976, with a radical Social Democratic agenda, there were sighs
of relief all around in the western European capitals, as well as in
Washington.</p>
<p>In spite of their community of purpose over Portugal, successive US
Administrations nonetheless distrusted and feared the Eurocommunists.
The Americans believed that Berlinguer's real aim was to become part of
the government and then to seize power from within. The Soviets had even
more reason to dislike the constant hectoring from the Italians about
their own policies. Brezhnev was shocked when Berlinguer said openly, in
Moscow, that democracy was a "historically universal value upon which to
base an original socialist society" and furious when the Italian called
NATO a "shield useful for constructing socialism in
freedom."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en526en">^2^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en526} Even
so, Moscow had little alternative but to continue to support the western
European Communist parties both politically and financially, for fear of
losing all influence among them.</p>
<p>In the United States the main worry concerning Europe was to hold the
NATO alliance together as the Cold War grew colder in the late 1970s.
Ever since the 1940s some US policy-makers had worried about western
European, and especially West German, instincts for compromising with
the Soviets rather than confronting them. Most often such suspicions had
been misplaced. The western Europeans had, after all, built NATO,
together with the Americans, in order to defend themselves against what
they saw as a threat from the East. Very often the differences on key
defense issues between the United States and its main allies had been in
terms of tone, not content. And even if the Americans bore by far the
greatest military and financial burden in the defense of western Europe,
Washington had been keen to let the Europeans be part of making
decisions. The deliberative decision-making within NATO helped convince
all allies that they were there on equal terms, and not just as staffage
in a global Cold War.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-504}But as Superpower détente began to
collapse, many western European leaders were worried about what would
follow. Détente, they thought, had served Europe well. It had opened up
new avenues for contact across the Iron Curtain. Trust-building measures
between the military alliances had made Europeans feel more secure, and
these western European leaders were themselves vested in the détente
processes. It was <em>their</em> project, not just the Superpowers'. Not
surprisingly, they were looking for ways to keep European détente alive
even when relations between Moscow and Washington seemed to be in free
fall.</p>
<p>The Helsinki process, as it was often called after the conference held
there in 1975, was one way of keeping lines to the East open. The right
to send observers to military exercises, participation in academic
conferences, exchanges in science and technology, and the right for
western Europeans to travel freely to eastern Europe (but not, in
practice, the other way around) should be upheld in spite of conflicts
in other areas, most western European leaders thought. Chiefly, they
were preoccupied with trade and economic interaction. And since trade
between the blocs in Europe tended to be a one-way street, with the
export of western European goods to the east, both sides were keen to
find products that could flow in the opposite direction. The one that
stood out was Soviet oil and gas, and plans for gas pipelines from
Siberia to western Europe had been underway since the mid-1970s. Reagan,
predictably, put his foot down. When the western Europeans refused to
cancel the project, in 1981 Reagan slapped US sanctions on all
companies, including European companies, that contributed to building
the pipelines. Although the Americans later relented, considerable
damage was done to the perception of transatlantic unity.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-505}In terms of discussion of military
strategy the Americans had much less to fear from their allies, although
they did not always realize that this was so. When the Carter
Administration in 1977 wanted to introduce high-radiation nuclear
weapons for battlefield use (so-called neutron bombs) in Europe, most
western Europeans leaders went along. They feared the Soviet advantage
in conventional forces, especially if there were to be deep cuts in the
strategic nuclear arsenals, and believed the neutron bomb could help
offset that advantage. Public opinion in almost all western European
countries was of a different view. The neutron bomb was decried as an
inhumane weapon that killed people and spared property. Exactly the kind
of weapon, the western European Left argued, that US capitalists would
like to see. When Carter unilaterally cancelled the deployment a year
later, those western European leaders who had supported the proposal
were furious. They felt that they had gone out on a political limb for
nothing.</p>
<p>The German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, was especially angry. He had
weathered public opinion on the neutron bomb and felt betrayed. Schmidt,
who regarded himself as an expert on strategic matters (and on most
other matters, too), had already formed a very low opinion of Carter as
a leader. But the West German chancellor, who was by far the most
powerful politician in Europe, was also concerned about Soviet
intentions. He was especially worried that a combination of Carter's
naiveté and Soviet military strength in Europe could tempt the Americans
to compromise with the Soviets, to western Europe's disadvantage.
Schmidt believed that the US position in the world was slipping and that
Europeans had to prepare to fend more for themselves. But he was also
keen to keep the Americans in Europe to the highest degree possible for
strategic reasons, as long as Schmidt himself could influence key
decisions in NATO.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-506}What particularly worried western European
strategic planners was that the Soviet and Warsaw Pact advantage in
conventional forces was being augmented by Brezhnev's introduction of
new highly mobile medium-range ballistic missiles, the SS-20s. The
Soviets deployed the new weapons because they knew the missiles they
replaced were of very poor quality, and because there were no treaties
that prohibited them from doing so. But it was a political mistake
because western European leaders felt it to be an attempt at
intimidation in troubled times. It was Helmut Schmidt, more than anyone,
who cobbled together the NATO response, the so-called double-track
decision of December 1979. In it, the NATO partners said they would
prepare the deployment of US medium-range Pershing II and cruise
missiles in western Europe in response to the Soviet deployment. At the
same time, NATO invited negotiations on limiting the number of all
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe on an equal basis, as part of
what would be the SALT III talks. This was an important decision. It
kept NATO united, sent a clear message to the Soviets, and---maybe most
importantly---made it plain that western European leaders more than ever
took responsibility for their own defense.</p>
<p>There was to be no SALT III, however. Two weeks after NATO's
double-track decision, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Most western
European leaders, except Britain's new prime minister, Margaret
Thatcher, thought Carter overreacted to the Soviet action. "We will not
permit ten years of détente and defense policy to be destroyed," Helmut
Schmidt told his
colleagues.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en527en">^3^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en527}
Schmidt, who was in essence Germany's most pro-American chancellor since
Konrad Adenauer, felt that Washington was failing in consulting its
allies. He also really started to fear that the world was heading toward
Superpower war. He told Carter that West Germany would agree to joint
NATO measures against the invasion, but that he himself would keep
communication lines with Moscow open. Against US wishes, Schmidt
traveled to Moscow in June 1980 to meet with Brezhnev. With his usual
bluntness, Schmidt told the aging Soviet leader that he thought the
invasion of Afghanistan had been a grave mistake. But he also asked for,
and got, Soviet concessions on discussing nuclear arms in Europe. The
USSR was willing to talk, Brezhnev said, as long as <em>all</em> nuclear
weapons in Europe were part of the discussion.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-507}Brezhnev's willingness to talk indicated
his worry about how fast tensions were rising on a global scale. But the
form the initiative took was also meant to pry open differences in NATO.
France and Britain had their own nuclear weapons, which they did not
want to negotiate over. West Germany did not. The Soviets were still
hoping that West Germany's dependence on the United States and Germany's
position as a Cold War front line state could help Moscow appeal to
German nationalist instincts. But the 1980 initiatives on medium-range
missiles were soon overtaken by further increases in tension between the
two power blocs. By 1983 Cold War anxiety in Europe was at its highest
level since the early 1960s because of the rhetorical confrontation
between Reagan and the Soviet leaders. More than half of all western
Europeans polled believed they would see a war between the Superpowers
in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Leonid Brezhnev died in November 1982 after eighteen years as Soviet
leader. He was not mourned by many. Even his closest colleagues had
begun to sense that the Soviet Union had come to a standstill during the
final phase of his leadership. Brezhnev had without doubt improved the
international position of the Soviet Union and made it a military
Superpower at a level his predecessors could only have dreamt about. But
the foreign expansion of the USSR had taken place at great economic cost
and, many Communists felt, at the expense of solving problems at home.
Brezhnev's successor, Iurii Andropov, was selected because his
colleagues thought he could handle foreign affairs and provide impetus
for necessary adjustments at home. As chairman of the secret police, the
KGB, for fifteen years, Andropov had the skill and the ruthlessness
needed to shake things up, his aging Politburo colleagues believed.</p>
<p>But Andropov, though aware of the need for domestic reform, was a sick
man already when he was made general secretary, and therefore incapable
of doing much. He died in February 1984. His replacement, Konstantin
Chernenko, was an apparatchik and Brezhnev crony who wanted to keep a
steady ship without much thought of reform. Chernenko was also unwell
when he was elected. He died after little more than a year in office.
Not surprisingly the party cadre and the population in general thought
that leadership of the party was drifting. A friend of mine, who lived
in Moscow at the time, claimed that his six-year-old son got so used to
hearing Chopin's funeral march on television that he thought it was the
Soviet national anthem.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-508}And while an elderly Politburo struggled
to stay alive physically and politically, Cold War tensions kept on
rising. The Soviets began worrying in earnest about the risk of a US
surprise nuclear attack, and took steps to increase surveillance of key
Western institutions. The KGB was ordered to keep watch for political,
financial, and religious leaders traveling toward nuclear shelters or
safe zones, for any increases in the capacity of blood banks, and for
hospitals being readied. This intelligence operation, called RIaN
(short, in Russian, for "nuclear missile attack"), probably helped
convince Soviet leaders that no immediate attack was underway. But
tensions remained high. In September 1983 the Soviet air force shot down
a civilian Korean airliner that had strayed into Soviet airspace. The
Soviets had mistaken it for a US spy plane. All 269 people aboard were
killed, 61 of them Americans, including a US congressman.</p>
<p>The Soviets made this terrible case of mass murder even worse in Cold
War terms through initially lying about their involvement, claiming that
they had not shot down the plane. US Cold War hawks had a field day.
Reagan's UN ambassador, the neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick, played US
intelligence recordings of transmissions between the Soviet pilots and
their air defense command at the UN Security Council. Reagan himself
went on national television, calling it "the Korean airline massacre,
the attack by the Soviet Union against 269 innocent men, women, and
children aboard an unarmed Korean passenger plane. This crime against
humanity must never be forgotten, here or throughout the
world."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en528en">^4^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en528}</p>
<p>In November 1983 things got really ugly. For years NATO had held
military exercises, usually in the fall, in order to test alliance
readiness to withstand a sudden Warsaw Pact attack. The 1983 version,
codenamed Able Archer '83, simulated conflict escalation up to the point
when nuclear strikes were launched. The Soviets had been notified about
the exercise beforehand, and knew quite a bit about it from their own
intelligence sources. Still, when Able Archer got underway, tensions
grew. The CIA reported later that Moscow had placed "Soviet air units in
East Germany and Poland on heightened
readiness."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en529en">^5^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en529} There
is no reason to believe that the Soviet leaders thought an attack was
imminent, but Moscow's reaction showed just how volatile and dangerous
the overall situation was. The world, and Europe especially, was closer
to a situation where nuclear war could break out accidentally than it
had been for a long time.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-509}The fear that was engulfing the Soviet
leaders was not just a product of the pressure they were under from the
West. It also came about because the economic and social system they
represented seemed to be in trouble. Economic growth was slowing. A
decline in oil prices sharply reduced the Soviet state's foreign income.
Andropov and others castigated sloth, corruption, and drunkenness. While
no Soviet leader thought that the system they had inherited needed
fundamental change, most were aware that it needed reform. The Soviet
state, many Communist leaders agreed, was overextended. The high degree
of centralization in planning hobbled the economy. Military expenditure
was growing too quickly, and the Soviet Union supported too many Third
World states and movements that were becoming accustomed to living off
Moscow's largesse. But while questions abounded, few had any answers.
And even the questions could not be posed too loudly. The Soviet Union
was a dictatorship, and the currency for promotion was loyalty.</p>
<p>If things were not looking too good in the Soviet Union, they were
beginning to look even worse in eastern Europe. Granted, many eastern
Europeans, in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, for instance, had a standard
of living that Soviet citizens could only dream of. But even so, the
sense spread of the leaders' inability to deal with the most pressing
problems, including secure and stable supplies of consumer goods. It was
not that eastern Europeans on a whole were living worse lives than
before. It was that many of them knew how much better people in western
Europe were living and how quickly progress was made there. The
increased contacts across the Iron Curtain after Helsinki had convinced
many eastern Europeans, especially professionals, teachers, and
managers, that their lives were much poorer than those lived across the
borders in the West. More than before they compared themselves not with
their own past, or with the Soviet Union, but with other Europeans whose
lives they thought they knew, through glimpses on television, film, or
chance encounters.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-510}Something else had changed, too. The fear
of German revanchism and expansionism, so much touted by the Soviets,
had ceased having much of an impact on younger eastern Europeans. This
was important, especially in Poland. Over a third of Polish territory
had been German before the war. But Brandt's <em>Ostpolitik</em> and the high
level of interaction with both Germanies had done away with much of the
unease that had existed in the past. It left Poles free to be concerned
about their own affairs, and they had much to complain about, especially
workers and their families. Poland had fallen behind most other eastern
European countries in terms of growth. In 1970, when the government
tried to raise prices on ordinary goods, workers protested. "What is
communism?" went the joke in Warsaw. "It is when everything will be
available in stores. In other words, like it was before the revolution."</p>
<p>The large-scale workers' protests in 1970 frightened the Polish
government. With Soviet consent, it tried to borrow its way out of the
crisis. Just like countries in Latin America, the Poles and other East
Bloc governments found western banks and institutions eager to lend
money in the 1970s. Poland was seen as a solid borrower: it had a stable
system of government and at least some products that could be exported
(coal, ships, and agricultural produce). Nobody really considered the
inefficiency of production and the shoddiness of the products, which led
to nobody outside the East Bloc wanting to buy their goods. The Polish
Communists borrowed about \$20 billion up to 1977, when the patience of
their Western creditors started to run out. The regime had to increase
prices, again, in order to pay back its loans.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-511}Like in 1970, Polish workers would not
accept worse conditions without a fight. They felt things were bad
enough already. And by 1978 they had a new inspiration for their
struggle. The deeply Catholic Polish working class that year celebrated
the election of a Polish Pope. The first non-Italian elected since the
sixteenth century, Karol Cardinal Wojtyła took the name John Paul II. He
had been the archbishop of Kraków, a vigorous and athletic man of
fifty-eight, a theological conservative who had always been close to
workers in his home country. The Communist leaders simply did not dare
refuse him permission to visit Poland after his election. More than a
quarter of the Polish population saw him in person to celebrate mass
during his tour of the country in 1979. "If we accept all that I have
dared to affirm in this moment, how many great duties and obligations
arise?" the pontiff asked his countrymen. "Are we capable of them?... It
is impossible without Christ to understand this nation with its past so
full of splendor and also of terrible difficulties.... Let your Spirit
descend," prayed John Paul, "and renew the face of the earth, the face
of this land." His audience chanted: "We want God, we want
God."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en530en">^6^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en530}</p>
<p>In August 1980 the workers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk went on
strike. Led by the young electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers occupied
the shipyard and demanded improved pay and working conditions. When
other factories joined in the strike, the demands were expanded to
include free trade unions, freedom of expression, and the release of
political prisoners. With strikes spreading and other groups joining the
workers, the Polish Communist Party gave in to some of the demands.
Desperate to get its working class to cooperate in increasing
production, the government felt that it had little choice but to give
in. At the end of the month, Communist negotiators had agreed to a new
independent trade union, Solidarity, as well as the release of prisoners
and most of the workers' economic demands. The talks inside the
shipyard, with Wałęsa and other workers' leaders challenging the
profusely sweating Communist cadre in their suits and ties, were shown
live on television. It was a sight most Poles never thought they would
live to see.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-512}By 1981 Solidarity had almost ten million
members and its own publications and publishing houses. The Communist
government tried to keep censorship in place, but with less and less
success. The party itself was badly split on how to handle the
Solidarity challenge. Some leading members, including the new first
secretary, Stanisław Kania, wanted to build a lasting compromise with
Solidarity and other non-Communist groups. They wanted all parts of
Polish society to be responsible for the dire economic situation the
country was in. They still wanted the Communist Party in charge in order
to stave off a Soviet intervention. But all other matters were
negotiable, at least over time. As could be expected, Moscow and the
other Warsaw Pact capitals brought enormous pressure to bear on the
Poles. They wanted Kania replaced, Solidarity banned, and censorship
expanded. Their support went to the defense minister, General Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who replaced Kania as first secretary in October 1981.</p>
<p>On 13 December 1981 Jaruzelski introduced martial law and cracked down
on Solidarity. Five thousand of its leaders were arrested. The new
regime brought back heavy censorship, and military units patrolled the
streets. To disgruntled Communist Party members, Jaruzelski claimed that
he had introduced martial law because of the clear and immediate risk of
a Soviet Red Army invasion. This was almost certainly untrue. When
Jaruzelski developed the plan for martial law together with the Soviets,
they pushed him to implement it, while making it clear that if the
operation failed the Red Army would not intervene to bail him out. After
Afghanistan, with economic problems mounting and Superpower tension
increasing, the Soviet Union simply could not risk moving their forces
into Poland. Andropov had put it in very clear terms to the Moscow
Politburo on 10 December:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
We cannot risk such a step. We do not intend to introduce troops into
Poland. That is the proper position, and we must adhere to it until the
end. I do not know how things will turn out in Poland, but even if
Poland falls under the control of "Solidarity," that is the way it will
be. And if the capitalist countries pounce on the Soviet Union, and you
know they have already reached agreement on a variety of economic and
political sanctions, that will be very burdensome for us. We must be
concerned above all with our own country and about the strengthening of
the Soviet Union.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en531en">^7^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en531}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-513}Perspectives were starting to shift in
other eastern European countries, too, though more slowly than in
Poland. Hungary under János Kádár had long had the most liberal
political regime in the Warsaw Pact. In the 1980s its economy was
slowing, and like Poland, it had made up for the shortfall through
Western loans. But Hungary also had more economic interaction with the
West than any other Soviet bloc country. Since 1976 the Buda Heights, so
destroyed in the fighting in 1945, had had its own Budapest Hilton
Hotel. Visitors from other eastern European countries used to scramble
up the hillside just to gawk at its turrets. Hungarians themselves were
relatively free to travel. In 1985 more than five million Hungarians
traveled abroad, about a third of them to western Europe. One of them
reported later on her experiences: "I was so overwhelmed when I went to
the West for the first time that I couldn't even process all the
information I was bombarded with during those three weeks.... In Eastern
Europe we had to fight to have the very rights Westerners took almost
for granted.... There was fresh food in the markets, even at weekends,
and I didn't have to stand in a long queue to buy a loaf of
bread."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en532en">^8^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en532}</p>
<p>The people of Hungary or Czechoslovakia regarded themselves less and
less as "eastern Europeans" left by others for Soviet domination.
Instead they began recasting themselves as central Europeans, under
occupation by a strange, oriental Soviet culture. If, say, Norway or
Portugal were part of the European mainstream, why were not they? In
Hungary the opposition was mainly intellectual or commercial. In
Czechoslovakia, after 1968 a much harsher dictatorship, the opposition
demanded political rights and the undoing of the regime imposed after
the Soviet invasion. Charta '77 was a manifesto of political dissidents,
ranging from underground rock bands to leading opposition figures, such
as the playwright Václav Havel. It condemned political oppression in
Czechoslovakia: "Freedom of public expression is inhibited by the
centralized control of all the communication media and of publishing and
cultural institutions. No philosophical, political or scientific view or
artistic activity that departs ever so slightly from the narrow bounds
of official ideology or aesthetics is allowed to be published; no open
criticism can be made of abnormal social phenomena; no public defense is
possible against false and insulting charges made in official
propaganda."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en533en">^9^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en533}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-514}The Prague rock group Plastic People of
the Universe put it more succinctly: "Whoever is now twenty, he wants to
vomit with
disgust."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en534en">^10^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en534} The
band members were arrested. Havel was arrested, too. He was sentenced to
four years' imprisonment in 1979.</p>
<p>The Soviet and eastern European attacks on dissidents helped
delegitimize Marxism-Leninism in the eyes of most people elsewhere. In
the USSR the few outspoken political dissidents who existed were
imprisoned or exiled. In some cases they were committed to psychiatric
hospitals, where they were pumped with drugs intended to make them
docile and cooperative. Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet dissident who in
1976 was "exchanged" for the imprisoned Chilean Communist leader Luis
Corvalán, had spent years in psychiatric institutions. So had General
Piotr Grigorenko, a Red Army officer who protested political oppression
in the Soviet Union. The physicist Andrei Sakharov, one of the founders
of the Moscow Helsinki Group, a dissident body set up to monitor Soviet
(non-)compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords, was spared such
humiliating treatment. But that was only because he was one of the
fathers of the Soviet nuclear program and the winner of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize. Instead Sakharov was sent in internal exile to the city of
Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), where he was kept under strict surveillance
and away from the international press. In his Nobel Prize acceptance
speech, read by his wife Elena Bonner, Sakharov stressed "the link
between defense of peace and defense of human rights,... [only] the
defense of human rights guarantees a solid ground for genuine long-term
international
cooperation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en535en">^11^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en535}</p>
<p>The East German authorities prided themselves both on economic progress
and on sophisticated methods of controlling any potential opposition.
But from the late 1970s on it was clear that at least the former of
these aims was in trouble. Compared to other countries in the Soviet
bloc the GDR was still doing well. Its people had the highest standard
of living and the highest productivity. But the all-pervasive secret
police, the Stasi (short for State Security Service), which kept
individual files on more than a third of all East Germans, reported that
all was not well. The curious shortages that people were subjected to
(coffee disappeared from the shelves for a while in 1976, bananas and
oranges in 1979) made some East Germans unhappy, especially as many of
them could watch on television the abundance of goods in West Germany.
The Stasi was still able to contain any kind of open opposition and East
Germans did, on the whole, obey the government. But the East German
leaders knew that they had to improve the economy. As they grumbled
among themselves, what the GDR competed against was not Poland or
Bulgaria, but the most advanced industrial economy in the Western world,
which also happened to be German.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-515}Like most other eastern European
countries, the GDR tried to stimulate its economy by getting loans from
the West, and especially from West Germany. The East German problem in
the 1980s was not, by itself, the level of indebtedness, but the decline
in hard currency exports that would make it possible to service this
debt. In the 1950s and '60s East Germany had lots of products, from
optics to cars, that could be sold outside the Soviet bloc. These
exports slowed in the 1970s. By the 1980s East Germany was entirely
outcompeted by southern European and Asian countries that could make
better products for a lower price. The East German attempt at using its
technological know-how to produce computers for export failed entirely.
Nobody wanted big and clunky East Germans machines that were not
compatible with anything produced outside the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>For the East German leaders, keeping détente alive increasingly became a
not-too-sophisticated form of blackmail against West Germany. West
Germans were allowed to visit the East, but only if they exchanged a
certain sum of hard currency into East German marks, worthless outside
of the GDR. East Berlin threatened to cut off contacts if West Germany
did not provide further loans or agree to economic deals, always with
the East German mark rated at parity with the West German deutschmark.
The new conservative West German government under Helmut Kohl, who
replaced Helmut Schmidt in 1982, continued these concessions to East
Berlin. Like Schmidt, Kohl believed that some form of contact was better
than no contact. Most shocking of all, the West German government had to
pay in hard currency for each East German who was allowed to leave for
the West. Not surprising that by the mid-1980s some Germans in the east
had started feeling that they, as a people, were quite literally held
hostage by a failed government. But almost all of them restricted their
complaints to family and close friends alone.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-516}East Germany's fundamental problem was
that it was simply too close to the biggest success story in Europe, the
Federal Republic of Germany. And through the FRG, it was too close to
the processes of European integration that by the mid-1970s had been
swinging into high gear. On its own, compared to countries on the
European periphery or outside of Europe, the GDR might still look OK.
But compared to the industrial and financial powerhouse in the west, it
seemed almost like a failed state. And West Germany was now building on
its success to advance further integration among all the capitalist
states in Europe, exactly the kind of system that East Germany could not
be part of.</p>
<p>After the expansion of the European Community (EC) to include Britain,
Ireland, and Denmark in 1973, the European Commission pushed ahead with
plans for further integration. Helped by the West German and French
governments, plans for direct elections to the European Parliament were
passed. So were plans for a single western European market in which
people, goods, services, and capital could move freely across borders.
Such steps were needed, many European leaders thought, if their
countries were not to fall behind the United States and Japan in
economic development. While these plans took time to be fully
implemented, just moving toward them undoubtedly stimulated European
economies, including the West German, which otherwise would have been
seen as stagnating (at least compared with the growth of the three
previous decades). They also encouraged competition, heightened
efficiency, and facilitated the spread of technology. But first and
foremost the work to create a union of European states signaled the
strength of a common set of ideas, which had not always been visible in
European cooperation before. In their Stuttgart Declaration from 1983,
western European leaders committed themselves "to create a united
Europe, which is more than ever necessary in order to meet the dangers
of the world situation, capable of assuming the responsibilities
incumbent on it by virtue of its political role, its economic potential
and its manifold links with other
peoples."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en536en">^12^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en536}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-517}The sense that the intensification of the
Cold War created a pressure to speed up both the form and the extent of
European integration was visible in all western European capitals.
Greece was fast-forwarded to become a full member of the EC in 1981.
Spain and Portugal joined in 1986. These were to a high extent Cold War
decisions (which US leaders, by the way, very strongly supported). In
being offered EC membership, the countries of southern Europe signed up
to a form of socially responsible capitalism, in which they would
receive aid if, but only if, they forwent the revolutionary alternative.
And aid they did get, both before and after they became full members of
the EC. By the late 1980s these poorest countries in Europe were seeing
a massive lift in enterprise, welfare, and average income. I remember a
Portuguese farmer from impoverished Alentejo explaining to me in 1988
why he no longer supported the Communist Party: European aid, he said,
made hope of a better life possible.</p>
<p>The expansion of the EC to encompass southern Europe was of enormous
significance for the Cold War. For eastern Europeans it held out the
promise that they, too, could join a European community. For people in
Prague or Budapest it was difficult to understand why farmers in
Alentejo or fishermen in Crete could benefit from European integration
while they could not. This perception was a time bomb under Soviet rule
in eastern Europe. It signaled that the alternative to a division of
Europe into power blocs might not be war or dislocation, but a world in
which countries joined up to decide their own future without Superpower
control. The worst enemy of Communist control was not NATO military
maneuvers, but the promise of affluence when walls through Europe were
removed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-518}Another consequence of the speeding up of
the European integration process was the expansion of regional
identities. Instead of focusing solely on the state they lived within,
more and more Europeans began thinking of themselves as members of
regions that either transcended state borders or stood out within these
borders. German-speaking Italians in South Tyrol could link up more
closely to people on the other side of the Austrian border.
French-speaking Walloons in Belgium connected to their counterparts in
France. In Spain Catalans and Basques demanded recognition as separate
nationalities. Some of this led to conflict, but in most cases the
concept of there being a common European integration process within
which smaller nationalities could find their place even without full
national independence helped ameliorate the tension between regions and
states.</p>
<p>The question, however, was what would happen where Cold War division
lines separated distinct European regions. By the mid-1980s the many
links that had historically connected Bratislava, Budapest, and Vienna,
three old capitals at the heart of Europe, became easier to see. Writers
in all three countries began referring to their location in central
Europe, even if the Cold War borders that separated them were still in
place. In the Balkans identity issues were becoming increasingly
complex. Hungarians in Romania were protesting the harsh treatment they
received from the Ceauşescu government. Albanians in Yugoslavia had
begun demanding independent rights. And elsewhere inside Yugoslavia
agitation for the rights of the individual nations, Croats and Slovenes
especially, had been stepped up. Some believed that such problems could
only be solved within a wider framework for European integration. But so
far the Cold War stood in the way, and the capacities of the European
institutions were in no way up to the task of breaking down such
barriers on their own.</p>
<p>Not all governments in Europe saw their interests served by a deepening
integration in all areas, as the Stuttgart Declaration had called for.
Margaret Thatcher, the free market ideologue who had become British
prime minister in 1979, was a strong supporter of a western European
common market. She also believed that the EC could help "realizing our
common European strength to ensure the further spread of democracy and
freedom and justice," as she put it to the European Parliament in
1986.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en537en">^13^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en537} But she
was profoundly skeptical of further political integration and feared
both for British sovereignty and its "special relationship" with the
United States. The latter was mirrored in the close personal
relationship Thatcher had with Ronald Reagan, who other western European
leaders, at least at first, regarded as a dogmatic dimwit.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-519}Thatcher's status was augmented by her
successful war against Argentina for control of the Falkland Islands in
the South Atlantic. It was a conflict that in the eyes of the rest of
the world, at least, came out of nowhere. After the Argentinian military
regime took over the British-controlled islands of roughly 1,800 people
in 1982, Thatcher sent a full British naval expedition eight thousand
miles to reconquer them. The Reagan Administration, focused on the Cold
War and worried about the stability of the Argentinian military regime
against its Leftist challengers, wanted time for mediation. "I think an
effort to show we're all still willing to seek a settlement," Reagan
told the British prime minister on the telephone, "... would undercut
the effort of... the Leftists in South America who are actively seeking
to exploit the crisis." Thatcher would have nothing of it. "This is
[about] democracy and our island, and the very worst thing for
democracy would be if we failed now," she told the
president.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en538en">^14^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en538} The
British took back the islands, with almost a thousand lives lost, most
of them Argentinians. The war did little damage to the British-American
relationship, but it did remind Reagan that there were other conflicts
that needed handling besides the Cold War.</p>
<p>French leaders' biggest concern with the European integration process
was how to prevent West Germany from becoming too predominant
politically as well as economically. France had been a driver for
European integration, and this approach continued under François
Mitterrand, the Socialist who was elected president in 1981. Mitterrand
at first seemed to set out on a more Left-wing course for France, and to
the consternation of the Americans included several Communists in his
government. But after his first year and a half in power, with the
French economy in real trouble, the new president switched tack. Instead
of talking about tax increases and nationalizations, Mitterrand moved
toward fiscal and monetary prudence in an attempt to make French
industry more competitive within Europe. The Communists were quietly
dropped from his government, and the concept of a French Left
alternative to "Anglo-Saxon" capitalism went out the window. All over
western Europe, Mitterrand's Right turn was of great significance. It
meant that a free market social and economic model would be in the
driver's seat in an expanded EC, even if there were still marked
differences between Mitterrand's France and Thatcher's Britain.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-520}It is tempting to see the increase in
small-scale terrorist activities in western Europe in the late 1970s as
a reaction against the end of the sharp Left/Right divides in official
politics. The small minorities of the extreme Left or Right who believed
that the postwar western European states were illegitimate and
exploitative had moved toward terrorism in the 1960s. But it was only a
decade later that groups such as the West German Rote Armee Fraktion,
also known as the Baader-Meinhof Group, and the Italian Brigate Rosse
were firmly established. The spectacular acts of terrorism that they,
and their rivals on the Right, carried out up to the end of the 1980s
were probably a sign of how such groups were losing out within ordinary
political competition. But even so, the murders of the head of the
German Employers' Union Hanns Martin Schleyer by Baader-Meinhof in 1977
and of the former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro by the Brigate Rosse
the following year shook up politics all over Europe.</p>
<p>But much worse for East-West relations were the suspicions in Bonn and
elsewhere of collaboration between the Communist regimes in the East and
terrorists in the West. Several Baader-Meinhof terrorists received
military training in the East, and the East German Stasi supplied them
with information about West German attempts at capturing them. East
Germany and Bulgaria also facilitated links between western European
terrorists and extremist movements in the Middle East and Japan, such as
the Palestinian PFLP-GC (the Abu Nidal group) and the Japanese Red Army,
a tiny terrorist organization operating in the Middle East. This was a
dangerous game. Some eastern European and Soviet officials may have
believed that it would help them destabilize societies in the West. In
reality it reminded western leaders of the illegitimate character of the
eastern regimes themselves and helped make the Cold War more risky.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-521}Western European terrorism also helped
governments undermine other challenges to their policies. But attempting
to taint young people's protest movements of the 1970s and '80s with
smears of terrorist links backfired in the longer run. Especially after
Ronald Reagan became US president, groups that advocated nuclear
disarmament moved into the mainstream, as did environmental movements.
In October 1983, more than three million western Europeans participated
in rallies against NATO missile deployments. In London and in Bonn at
least 250,000 people marched, under slogans such as "Ban the Bomb" and
"Stop Nuclear Suicide." The West German Green Party, which was founded
in 1980, linked disarmament with ending environmental destruction on
both sides of the Iron Curtain. They got significant support for their
positions: two-thirds of all West Germans polled in 1983 opposed new
NATO missiles in Europe under any
circumstance.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en539en">^15^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en539}</p>
<p>What was new with the western European protest movement in the 1980s was
that it was increasingly directed against militarism and oppression both
in the West and the East. The campaign group European Nuclear
Disarmament (END), launched in 1980, demanded the withdrawal of Soviet
SS-20 missiles as well as saying no to new NATO weapons. What was worse
from a Soviet perspective, many of the END leaders had close contacts
with dissidents in eastern Europe. E. P. Thompson, a veteran British
peace campaigner and former Communist, declared that "there is an
immediate link between real disarmament and the development of
democratic movements in the Socialist states. Furthermore, the creation
of democratic movements in them is a precondition for forcing the
Socialist states to
disarm."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en540en">^16^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en540} In the
1980s, the European Left seemed to have rediscovered the link between
rights and liberties and Left-wing politics. The Helsinki process gave
nuclear protesters an opportunity to meet with dissidents such as Havel
in Czechoslovakia or with disenchanted members of the Communist Party in
Hungary. They discovered that they had much in common on a broad set of
concerns.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-522}One such issue was the environmental
degradation that the Cold War in Europe had contributed to. Not only
were military industries big polluters, but nuclear energy, toxic waste,
and deforestation were in many people's minds connected to the Cold War
competition for production. Political parties such as the Greens and
movements such as END made these links in their campaigns, sometimes
criticizing the East as much as the West. But environmental criticism of
the Cold War also found its way into the political mainstream. The youth
wings of all the main West German parties believed that East-West
agreements on "common security" were a precondition for solving acute
environmental problems. Even the West German Christian Democrats, now in
power under Helmut Kohl, in its 1984 program saw the reduction in
polluting industries and the universal use of catalytic converters in
cars as part of Germany's core international
policies.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en541en">^17^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en541}</p>
<p>But it was not only Europeans who were concerned about the wider effects
of the Cold War. To a degree that would have astonished his European
detractors, US president Ronald Reagan had begun worrying that nuclear
war could break out by accident, or that the Soviet Union could feel
pushed into launching a first strike on the West. Reagan believed that
the United States was winning the Cold War. A sunny optimist by nature,
the president felt that America's greatness had been restored by his
election and by his actions during his first two years in office,
including the military buildup. He also believed that the rest of the
world was gradually turning in America's direction, toward free markets
and democracy. Any nuclear conflict would destroy these natural
processes, Reagan thought. Especially after the Able Archer affair, the
president began thinking more seriously about how conflict could be
avoided. "I feel the Soviet are so defense minded, so paranoid about
being attacked," Reagan wrote in his diary, "that without being in any
way soft on them we ought to tell them no one here has any intention of
doing anything like that. What the hell have they got that anyone would
want?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en542en">^18^</a>{#chapter019.xhtml#en542}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-523}Ever since he became president, Reagan had
been preoccupied with finding ways in which the United States could be
protected against a nuclear attack. He found the principles of mutually
assured destruction to be morally contentious and personally repugnant.
The thought of himself ever having to use the nuclear launch codes
horrified Reagan, who as president avoided most briefings or simulations
in which he would have to do so. Instead, the president in 1983
commissioned a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which would focus on
preventing nuclear missiles from ever reaching the US mainland. Dubbed
"Star Wars" by its detractors, these plans imagined the use of
space-based lasers to destroy incoming missiles. Even some of the
president's own science advisers suggested that it would not work, or at
least not within a generation or so. But Reagan persisted, pouring
billions into his new pet program.</p>
<p>SDI horrified the Soviets. Not only did it break with the principles
they had got so used to during the SALT negotiations, and therefore, in
their view, made the world a more dangerous place; but they also knew
that their side did not have the technology to compete and could not
afford massive new investments in science and technology in order to
catch up with the United States. Like their US counterparts, most Soviet
experts doubted that SDI was implementable, at least anytime soon. But
Soviet leaders could not take the risk of the Americans getting such
weapons without any response. Such retaliation, most experts believed,
could only come through new offensive technologies or through massive
increases in the throw weight of Soviet missiles, well beyond what the
SALT agreements would allow for.</p>
<p>Moscow's reaction to Reagan's dreams of a space-based interceptor
program against nuclear missiles exemplified the widening gap in
technology between West and East. By the mid-1980s the West was ahead in
most fields, from satellites to fiber-optic cables to computers. These
advances were made possible by alliances between government
funding---often military---and commercial companies that delivered the
goods. Soviet scientists and engineers had no problem understanding the
progress that was made in the West. They could probably have delivered
the same results for the Soviet Union, if there had been a system in
place flexible enough to put such technology into production. It was at
the production end that the Soviet Union was lagging behind, by design
as much as by inertia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-524}Satellites provide a good example. Up to
the 1970s the Soviet Union was ahead in satellite technology. Its Ekran
satellites delivered television to millions of Soviet citizens in
Siberia and the Pacific provinces well before any such system existed in
the West. But the Soviets, intentionally, did not see satellite TV as a
means for commercial purposes, and its international propaganda
broadcasts were more likely to make viewers turn their TVs off than on.
In the early 1980s American satellite stations began sending US news,
sports, series, and movies across the globe, in many cases accessible
for anyone who could afford a satellite dish. The message of consumerism
was an integral part of the new TV stations' appeal. And it was eagerly
received by most of those who could receive it.</p>
<p>The successes of commercial television indicated that in many parts of
the world people's priorities were beginning to change. This turn toward
consumerism went along with fundamental changes in the global economy
that got underway in the 1970s. As we have seen, the breakdown of the
Bretton Woods system of fixed rates, regulated trade, and capital
controls led to a sense of crisis in the West, and especially in the
United States. But it also reflected a relative improvement in the
economic position of others, above all in Asia. All over the globe,
except in the Communist countries, people were reinventing themselves as
consumers of products that earlier on had either not existed or been out
of reach for anyone but the top layers of society. From clothes to
electronics, from cosmetics to air conditioners, prices fell as
competition and the number of potential consumers both increased. Not
surprisingly, container-shipping capacity almost tripled during the
1980s.</p>
<p>Much of what happened in the global economy after the early 1970s
privileged the United States. Although its economic position as a
country relative to others continued to slip, its position at the center
of the world's financial system continued. The dollar remained the world
currency, and freed from previous constraints, the US government made
sure its value remained low in order to encourage both US exports and
foreign investments in the United States. But the United States could
also draw advantages from the globalization of trade and finance in the
1980s. US banks and, especially from the mid-1980s, US investment
companies could easily invest in foreign markets, knowing that they had
access to the one currency most other people wanted. New financial
instruments and technologies from the United States predominated
worldwide.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-525}The global financial revolution of the
1980s transformed the world economy and thereby changed the landscape of
one of the main battlefields of the Cold War. The massive increase in
investments, often in forms that nobody would have thought of before the
1970s, was made possible by a combination of government deregulation and
advances in information technologies. Well before electronic information
became a consumer staple, financial services put it to work in providing
investors with real-time information on markets and economic trends. The
combination of telecommunication and computing power---what we today
know as the Internet---was first developed in the United States for
military purposes. But it was as revolutionary for financial services as
for defense networks, and it tied the world of capital together around
American inventions and American principles.</p>
<p>The turn toward consumerism outside of the United States also helped US
businesses. Makers of more traditional goods often complained that they
were outcompeted by cheap imports, and even top-notch electronics and
cars were often produced better and cheaper outside the United States.
But the ideas, designs, and technologies on which they were built were
often American. Personal computers, for instance, were mainly based on
American (or at least US-owned) technology, giving rise to companies
such as Apple and Microsoft. What seemed a revitalization of the world's
hunger for American products, including its music and film, helped
sustain Reagan's rhetoric about freedom and choice being quintessential
American values. By the mid-1980s neoconservative politics upheld
neoliberal economics, and vice versa.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter019.xhtml#page-526}The United States did not create
globalization, or consumerism for that matter, as economic weapons in
the Cold War. But the Reagan Administration did use its influence over
major financial institutions to limit the economic room for maneuver of
anyone outside of Europe suspected of choosing a socialist development
model allied with the Soviet Union. The access to credit for countries
such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Angola, or Vietnam was next to nonexistent,
forcing them to rely on support from the Soviets and eastern Europeans,
which was less and less forthcoming. Even more important, however, for
the opponents of capitalism worldwide was the sense that global trends
and norms were moving in opposition to them and their ideals. Margaret
Thatcher's mantra that "there is no alternative" to capitalism in its
neoliberal form seemed to be a self-fulfilling prophesy, including for
those who resented its implications.</p>
<p>Even though these sentiments had come on rather suddenly and would turn
out to be a passing phase, at least in their most doctrinaire form, they
were remarkably powerful by the mid-1980s. To begin with, both Reagan
and Thatcher seemed to struggle to get control of the economy, and their
monetarist remedies were widely ridiculed. The 1982--83 recession was
the deepest the United States had experienced since the late 1950s. What
created the recovery, it could be argued, was less monetarist principles
than massive US deficit spending, mainly for military purposes, combined
with the creation of global markets, not least in financial terms. But
this did not matter to those who believed that monetarism and other
forms of neoliberal economics would save the world from the threat of
Communism and from the insidious introduction of socialism in the West.
Neither did it matter much to them that Reagan borrowed more money than
all his predecessors combined, or that the cost of public services grew
significantly during Thatcher's time in power. Their message far
overshadowed their practices. And that message---that individual freedom
mattered more than society's needs---resonated far beyond those who had
ever heard about monetarist policies.

<p>By the early 1980s the Soviet Union was roughly where the United States
had been a decade before. Its economy seemed set on a downward turn. Its
politics seemed dysfunctional, to the point that real leadership and
direction were hard to attain. And the public mood was dismal. People
who had been proud of Soviet achievements and at least tolerant of the
system's imperfections now started to doubt the future of Communism and
their own role within it. Like in the United States a decade earlier,
few Soviet people could envisage any alternative form of state and
society. But there was a distinct doubt about whether the regime could
continue as it was for much longer.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union in the 1980s also had two additional challenges that
the United States had not had to face in the previous decade. Never
having been tested at the voting booth, the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union (CPSU) had much less legitimacy than the US government,
even under weak presidents such as Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter. The
Communists had of course created the Soviet state and the advances that
went with it, in science, education, welfare, and military power, but
ever since Stalin's time Soviet leaders had seemed afraid of their own
people and in no way convinced of the support the CPSU would get from
them in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Internationally the Soviet Union also had challenges that the United
States had not had, even in the 1970s. Granted, Brezhnev's détente
policies, and the massive Soviet military buildup that had accompanied
them, had genuinely made the Soviet Union the other Superpower. It had
by far the most powerful forces in Europe or Asia and had shown that it
was capable of intervening globally when it so wished. But the USSR was
isolated from the global economic system to a degree that even its
eastern European allies were not. In 1985 only 4 percent of the Soviet
gross national product was connected to foreign trade outside the East
Bloc. Foreign investments were negligible. Even the much-vaunted gas
exports to western Europe were slow to make an impact. By 1985 the
Soviets supplied less than 3 percent of western Europe's natural gas.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-528}This isolation happened partly by the
Soviets' own design and partly through enforcement by others. Soviet
leaders were concerned that economic interaction with the capitalist
world, and especially a foreign presence inside the Soviet Union, would
lead to the spread of capitalist thinking and practices. Such a
development could usher in political unrest and eventually foment a
counterrevolution against the Communists. Foreign trade was of course
acceptable and the Soviets would have liked to expand it, but only on
their conditions of state-led initiatives and strict reciprocity. Any
Communist official charged with handling foreign commercial links had to
be doubly careful. Not only did political rectitude have to be shown at
all times, but any whiff of corruption by foreign interests had to be
avoided, or the KGB would swoop. No wonder some Soviet officials
preferred safety over ambition, even if that meant dealing with
collective enterprises in Omsk rather than more enticing foreign
ventures.</p>
<p>But the Western allies, and especially the United States, also tried to
prevent the Soviet Union from benefitting too much from economic
interaction with the West. Since the late 1940s, the Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) had placed
restrictions on products countries allied with the United States would
be allowed to export to the Soviet Union. These lists were quite
extensive, ranging from advanced agricultural equipment to aircraft
components to computers and software. Some of it the Soviets were able
to get through industrial espionage, but by no means all. At the same
time, direct trade with the United States nose-dived with the collapse
of détente. Already in 1974 the US Congress introduced an act (the
Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act) that restricted normal trade
relations with countries that did not allow free emigration (read, the
USSR). In 1980 President Carter embargoed US grain sales to the Soviet
Union as a reaction to the invasion of Afghanistan. Although Ronald
Reagan lifted the embargo the following year, having found that it did
more damage to US farmers than to the Soviets, it did much to undermine
Soviet trade relations with the West.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-529}Up to the late 1970s the Soviets could
ignore economic relations with the rest of the world, although they had
done so at their peril. They could claim that their own form of modern
development, a socialist, centralized planned economy, could deliver
economic progress at least to the same extent as the capitalist West.
But as capitalist globalization grew and more and more regions were
linked up through it, Soviet isolation began to stand out. The USSR,
after all, had been designed to <em>overtake</em> capitalism, not to fall
further and further behind. Especially as the US economy began a very
strong expansion from 1984 on, it seemed as if the Americans were
benefitting from trends the Soviets could not be part of. Almost as bad,
from a Soviet perspective, was the growth in the eastern Asian
economies, where even small countries that the Soviets had never been
much concerned about had growth rates three or four times the USSR's
average.</p>
<p>Domestically, leaders of the Andropov kind had believed that they could
will the Soviet economy to work better. Their campaigns against
corruption, drunkenness, and slovenliness showed little result in terms
of output, however. Before the 1917 revolution Russia had been a grain
exporter. By 1985 it was entirely dependent on foreign imports, bringing
in more than forty-five million tons that year alone. It also imported
nine hundred thousand tons of meat just to feed its
population.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en543en">^1^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en543} And
real reform was not forthcoming. The aging Politburo simply refused to
experiment with the economy in any meaningful sense. Even limited
reforms such as those in eastern Europe, not to mention China, were off
the table.</p>
<p>Ironically, one real danger for the Soviet economy was its increasing
dependence on oil and gas exports for access to hard currency. As we
have seen, Soviet foreign trade was small in size. But it needed hard
currency income in order to service its import credits. The profits from
energy exports, in good times, had also been used to expand beyond the
plan in domestic production of high-end consumer goods, which the plan
itself did not allow much room for. When oil prices nose-dived in 1981,
these parts of the Soviet economy had taken a real hit, even though the
planning bureaucracy tried to explain it as a temporary setback. But
people, especially in the cities, noticed that stores emptied out even
quicker and that lines for consumer products were longer than they had
been even during the 1950s.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-530}And then there was the war in Afghanistan.
Brezhnev had been promised a short intervention, the sending of a
"limited contingent" of Red Army troops to help the "real Communists" in
the Afghan party set things right. They would be out within months,
according to the materials the Politburo discussed in December 1979,
when the final decision to intervene was taken. But by 1985 Soviet
soldiers in Afghanistan had been fighting there for five years, and the
chances of any withdrawal seemed remote. Both Brezhnev, in the waning
years of his life, and his successor, Iurii Andropov, had been keen to
arrange a negotiated withdrawal. But the overall direction of the Cold
War counted against it. The Afghan Communist regime feared it would
collapse without Soviet troops in the country. And the Soviets would
only withdraw if the Americans and the Pakistanis agreed to stop
supplying the Afghan Islamist resistance. Chances for a withdrawal
anytime soon seemed remote.</p>
<p>By 1985 the Red Army had more than one hundred thousand troops in
Afghanistan. Most of the country seemed to be under control by them and
by the government army of the Afghan Communist Party, led by the vain
and ineffectual Babrak Karmal. But that was only during the day and when
Communist troops were nearby. At night, or when these troops had to be
concentrated or redeployed, the resistance had begun to move into
villages all over Afghanistan. Some of this resistance was local,
tribal, or clan-based. People were defending their own areas against
infidel foreigners and what they saw as a rapacious atheist regime in
Kabul. But increasingly these local fighters joined up with one of the
several Islamist parties based across the border in Peshawar, Pakistan,
in order to get access to weapons and supplies. In turn, these links
changed the tenor of the resistance ideology. In the 1970s nobody would
have thought that Islamism in its Middle Eastern form would have stood
much of a chance in idiosyncratic and recondite Afghanistan. But in the
decade that followed, groups such as the Hizb-i-Islami (the Islamic
Party)---with slogans borrowed from the Islamic Brotherhood, from
extremist preachers in Saudi Arabia, and even from the otherwise much
maligned Iranian Shia revolution---began to dominate the resistance
discourse in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-531}A key reason why the Afghan Islamists won
out over other groups in the resistance was the support they received
from the Pakistanis and the Americans. For the Reagan Administration the
calculus was simple: The Islamist groups seemed the best organized and
the most effective part of the resistance. They were less corrupt and
less likely to engage in the thousand local compromises that warfare in
Afghanistan normally demanded. Mostly they killed more Soviets. "We had
a very... cold-blooded view of things," commented Charles Cogan, the
CIA's south Asia chief in the early 1980s. "Our interest was in
reversing the tables on the Russians, after
Vietnam."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en544en">^2^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en544}</p>
<p>The Pakistani military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq encouraged CIA
director William Casey and Reagan in seeing the Afghan liberation
struggle as a battle of religion against Communist atheism. Zia used
conservative religious authorities as tools for ruling Pakistan,
especially after he had his democratically elected predecessor, Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, hanged in prison in 1979. The following year he introduced
Sharia courts, a novelty (to put it mildly) in Pakistani jurisprudence.
A US-trained officer with a particular fixation on the Indian threat to
Pakistan, Zia believed that it was only through increased support from
Washington that his country could maintain its independence. The Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan was Zia's lucky break. With considerable
success, he presented his case to Reagan: the real Soviet aim, Zia
claimed, was to destroy Pakistan in cooperation with India. In that way
the Soviets could dominate the Indian Ocean and control oil transports
from the Gulf.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-532}Even though they did not accept all of
Zia's pretentious claims of his country's importance, the Americans knew
that without the Pakistani dictator's cooperation, there was no way US
supplies could get to the Afghan resistance. By 1985 these supplies had
become a major operation. Reagan believed that by hitting Afghanistan
and other Soviet-supported regimes in Asia and Africa, he could increase
the price the Soviets paid for their foreign involvements. Although
there is no evidence that the president thought the United States could
force the Soviets to withdraw entirely, Reagan did expect that US arming
of anti-Leftist guerrilla forces could discourage Moscow from such
interventions in the future.</p>
<p>The Reagan Administration's aid for the Afghan mujahedin soon got
entangled with a dramatic stepping up of US assistance to other
movements worldwide. By 1985 this had turned into a major US offensive
against the Left in what used to be the Third World. In Angola the
United States supported, armed, and trained the guerrilla fighters of
Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), who were fighting against the Cuban-supported government. In
Cambodia the Americans helped the forces fighting against the
Vietnamese-supported government, including (at least indirectly) the
remnants of the notorious Khmer Rouge. In both of these countries, the
opposition stood no chance of winning outright militarily. But their
access to US weapons and military training ensured that the Left-wing
governments were unable to consolidate their hold on all of their
territory. It also prevented all forms of economic growth and increased
the cost to the Soviets, Cubans, and Vietnamese of keeping their allies
in power. For the moment, at least, this was good enough for Washington.
The United States was now using the same methods to put pressure on the
Soviets that the USSR had used against America in the 1970s, Reagan
believed.</p>
<p>Central America was a different case, and US aims were much wider. Since
Nicaragua and El Salvador were nearly on America's doorstep, Reagan's
appetite grew, from ensuring the Sandinistas end their support for
Left-wing rebels in El Salvador to the overthrow of the Nicaraguan
regime itself. In 1984 the CIA secretly mined Nicaraguan harbors to cut
it off from the outside world. But Reagan's problem was that Congress,
increasingly wary of another Vietnam-style quagmire, balked at funding
the US allies in Nicaragua, the Contras. In spite of his overall
popularity, Reagan could not get Congress to budge. The 1984 Boland
amendment prohibited any US government measure that "would have the
effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary
operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement, or
individual."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en545en">^3^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en545} The
CIA reported that the Contras, "even with American support, cannot
overthrow the Sandinistas." The only solution, the Agency's chief
analyst Robert Gates believed, was to "acknowledge openly... that the
existence of a Marxist-Leninist regime in Nicaragua... is unacceptable
to the United States and that the United States will do everything in
its power short of invasion to put that regime
out."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en546en">^4^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en546}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-533}With the president's tacit encouragement,
the Reagan White House and the CIA put in place a network for increased
support for the Contras that was badly thought out and almost certainly
illegal. The centerpiece of the system was donations, and sometimes
weapons, that the administration had solicited from friendly countries,
such as Saudi Arabia and Brunei. These supplies could be used covertly
to aid not only the Contras but also UNITA and the Afghan mujahedin. By
late 1985 the White House had expanded this system into a totally
harebrained scheme to sell weapons to Islamist Iran, now fighting for
its life against an Iraqi attack, and give the proceeds secretly to the
Contras. The aim would be to reach out to Iranian "moderates" to engage
them in the Cold War against the Soviets and get them to assist with the
release of US hostages held by Islamist terrorist groups in the Middle
East. The plans failed, and the ensuing political fallout came to
threaten the political survival of the Reagan presidency. But they
showed clearly how far Reagan and his assistants were willing to go to
in battling Soviet associates worldwide.</p>
<p>The aging leadership group in Moscow therefore feared not only Reagan's
rhetoric and America's technological advances; they were also looking
closely at what the US president was doing in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America. They understood it as a counterrevolutionary offensive and
associated it with a decisive US break with détente. On this matters had
been turned upside down as well. In the 1970s Ford and Carter had been
complaining of the Soviets risking détente for Angola or Ethiopia. Now
Andropov's successor, Konstantin Chernenko, claimed that Reagan's
aggression risked war. But the Soviet leader neither was nor seemed to
be in a position to stand up to the United States. Chernenko, born in
1911---the same year as Ronald Reagan---was fading. He could hardly read
his prepared texts in public. The day he was appointed leader of the
CPSU, Chernenko had shuffled along to Andropov's graveside, where he
nearly fell in and had to be steadied by other old-timers in the
Politburo. These were not men to face down such a massive US challenge.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-534}On 10 March 1985 Chernenko died. When the
Politburo members met to consider his successor, it was already clear
that a younger man would have to be found. The seventy-six-year-old
Andrei Gromyko, who had been foreign minister since 1957, nominated
Mikhail Gorbachev, who at fifty-four was the youngest member of the
Politburo. When each individual member, as usual, spoke to confirm his
support for a decision that had already been taken by the top leaders,
Vladimir Dolgikh, one of the lesser lights of Soviet politics, in a
somewhat tragi-comic manner provided the best summing up. "We are all
united," he said, "in the opinion that he [Gorbachev] not only has
great experience in his past, but he also has a future. Today our
country needs an energetic leader who would be capable of going deeply
into the substance of problems, a leader who is sincere, courageous and
demanding."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en547en">^5^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en547} And
that was exactly what the CPSU got in Gorbachev, to a degree that nobody
in March 1985 could have imagined possible.</p>
<p>Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev was born in Stavropol in southern Russia in
a mixed Russian-Ukrainian family. Both of his grandfathers were purged
during the Stalin era, and one of them was sent in exile to Siberia.
Gorbachev studied law at the prestigious Moscow State University, making
him the first Soviet leader with a university degree. While there, he
married the Ukrainian Raisa Titarenko, a philosophy graduate who would
have a great influence on her husband's career. And he joined the
Communist Party, which by 1970 had made Gorbachev the party leader in
his hometown and a member of the CPSU Central Committee at the
ridiculously young age of forty.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-535}Ten years later Gorbachev was a member of
the ruling Politburo. His portfolio was agriculture, and one might guess
that this notoriously unrewarding assignment was given him at least in
part to balance the fact that his rise as a party leader was
unprecedentedly quick. But in between the stages in his meteoric
political rise, Gorbachev also found time to do what young people in
1960s and '70s USSR longed to do above all else: go abroad. In the
summers of 1977 and '78 he and his wife traveled through France and
Italy as tourists, seeing the sights but also meeting with ordinary
people in a way that few other Soviet leaders-in-training had done. The
Gorbachevs could of course make these trips only because they were
especially trusted by the state; ordinary Soviets could only dream of
such an opportunity. But even so they wondered about what they saw and
about the reasons why it had so little impact in the Soviet Union. "It
seemed," wrote Gorbachev later, "that our aged leaders were not
especially worried about our undeniably lower living standards, our
unsatisfactory way of life, and our falling behind in the field of
advanced
technologies."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en548en">^6^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en548}</p>
<p>These concerns were precisely what the Gorbachevs set out to deal with
after Mikhail's election as general secretary. Gorbachev believed that
Soviet society needed to be invigorated through the strict oversight of
the Communist Party. People's morale needed to be rebuilt and their
faith in the future strengthened. He had few concrete proposals at
first, and those he had were taken straight out of Andropov's playbook:
an anticorruption campaign, a campaign against alcoholism. The latter,
by the way, did not exactly improve the new general secretary's
popularity, earning him the nickname "General Secretary Mineral Water."
"There was this long line for vodka, and one guy just could not stand it
any longer," went a favorite Moscow joke. "'I am going to the Kremlin,
to kill Gorbachev,' he said. An hour later, the guy came back. The line
was still there, and everyone asked him, 'Did you kill the General
Secretary?' 'Kill him?' he responded. 'The line for that is much longer
than this one!'"</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-536}To begin with, Gorbachev's style was more
important than his substance. He was young, vigorous, and liked to be
seen outside talking to people. But he was also authoritarian and
impatient. When a representative from the Ministry of Finance pointed
out that a significant part of government taxes came from alcohol
consumption, Gorbachev interrupted him: "There is nothing new in what
you have just said. Each of us knows that there is nothing to be
purchased for the cash held by people. But you are not proposing
anything other than forcing people to drink. So just report your ideas
briefly, you are not in the Finance Ministry, but at the Politburo
session."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en549en">^7^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en549}</p>
<p>But the Finance Ministry was not the only part of Soviet bureaucracy
that Gorbachev was impatient with. Party secretaries and ministers were
bombarded with letters and instructions about improving their
performance, and threatened with severe sanctions if they did not.
Before the 1986 Party Congress he purged many of the older leaders in
the Politburo and replaced them with his own people, selected from the
younger generation. Gromyko, who supposedly had remarked that Gorbachev
had a nice smile, but teeth of steel, was promoted to the largely
ceremonial role of Soviet president. His replacement as foreign minister
was the reform-oriented party head of the Soviet republic of Georgia,
Eduard Shevardnadze. Shevardnadze made up for his lack of foreign
experience through his dedication to the Communist Party organization.
For the new foreign minister, as for many Soviets who had waited almost
a generation for a dynamic and decisive leader, the general secretary's
authoritarian manner was easy to accept. And Shevardnadze was a quick
learner, someone Gorbachev could turn to with his ideas for a dramatic
change in the flagging international fortunes of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Gorbachev understood from the very beginning of his tenure that the USSR
needed to reduce its expenses in the arms race and in support for
revolutionary movements abroad. But he wanted to do so in ways that did
not reduce the international status of the Soviet Union or its position
as a global Superpower. The key, Gorbachev believed, was to get the
Soviet economy going again. And to make that happen, some form of
cooperation with the West was unavoidable. The general secretary doubted
that much could be achieved with the Americans. He described them to his
colleagues as "not serious." But he was hopeful that western European
governments, both in their own interest and in the interest of peace,
would reach out to the Soviet Union. "The European direction of our
diplomatic, political and other actions is extremely important for us.
Here we have to be much more consistent and flexible" than in the past,
Gorbachev said.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en550en">^8^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en550}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-537}In Washington, Reagan hoped for an early
summit with the new general secretary. In a personal letter to
Gorbachev, the president invited him to an early summit and referred,
somewhat whimsically, to a common "goal of eliminating nuclear
weapons."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en551en">^9^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en551} Ever
since the Able Archer incident, Reagan had been looking for concrete
ways of getting negotiations going with the Soviets on nuclear weapons.
The threat of nuclear war worried him deeply. After watching the ABC
drama <em>The Day After</em>, which depicts Lawrence, Kansas, after a nuclear
attack, Reagan noted that it "left me greatly
depressed."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en552en">^10^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en552} In
January 1984, in his State of the Union address, Reagan turned directly
to the Soviets with his appeal: "People of the Soviet Union, there is
only one sane policy, for your country and mine, to preserve our
civilization in this modern age: A nuclear war cannot be won and must
never be fought. The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear
weapons is to make sure they will never be used. But then would it not
be better to do away with them
entirely?"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en553en">^11^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en553}</p>
<p>Gorbachev, for some very good reasons, doubted the sincerity in Reagan's
appeal. But he worried about the increases in defense spending that the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program would inflict on the Soviet
Union. He also needed time to develop his European initiatives, which he
hoped would split the western Europeans from the United States in what
he saw as Reagan's warlike attitude to the Soviet Union. Although little
progress had been made at the off-and-on negotiations between the two
sides on nuclear weapons' issues in Geneva, Gorbachev agreed to a summit
meeting with the American president there, to take place in November
1985. It would be the first meeting between the top US and Soviet
leaders for six years. Neither side expected much in terms of concrete
results.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-538}The Geneva summit allowed the two leaders
to take the measure of each other, even though, as expected, it
delivered very little in practical terms. Reagan, warm, breezy, and at
times mundane, did little to impress Gorbachev, who came away with a
sense of a president who was the hostage of his advisers. The only time
Reagan really got through to him was when they parted. Past summits had
not achieved very much, Reagan said. The president "suggested that he
and Gorbachev say 'To hell with the past,' we'll do it our way and get
something done."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en554en">^12^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en554}
It was an expression of Reagan's frustrations with what he found to be a
plodding, detail-oriented Soviet negotiating style. But it was also an
indication of the president's belief that he could deal with Gorbachev
at the personal level and bring about results.</p>
<p>In his first year in power Gorbachev got increasingly impatient with the
lack of progress that he witnessed in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev had
believed that the new and inspirational leadership he provided would
mean that people would be willing to work harder to achieve economic
results within the plan. Instead Soviet economic growth continued to
stall and shortages were as visible as before. Impatiently, Gorbachev
rounded on his advisers. If they could not provide him with results,
they were not only failing him, they were failing the greatness of
Soviet society, he told them. At the twenty-seventh CPSU Party Congress
in the spring of 1986, Gorbachev called for "a qualitatively new state
of the Soviet socialist society." But he also warned the delegates about
"the shortcomings in our political and practical activities [and] the
unfavorable tendencies in the economy and the social and moral
sphere."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en555en">^13^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en555} It was
a very new form of report from the CPSU's general secretary, who also
used the Congress to underline his own leading position. After a year in
power, Gorbachev had unequivocally nailed his colors to the mast of
reform.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-539}Already at his first meetings after taking
over as head of the party, Gorbachev had referred to the war in
Afghanistan as "a bleeding wound." But that did not mean that he had
given up on winning the war by securing the Communist regime and
bringing the Red Army home in triumph. In meetings with his generals
during the summer of 1985, Gorbachev told them they had a year to come
up with a military strategy that actually worked in defeating the
Islamist insurgency. He allowed them to attack the mujahedin closer to,
and sometimes across, the Pakistani border, and agreed to more air
support and more weapons for the Afghan Communist army. But he also made
it entirely clear that if the new and more aggressive strategy did not
work, then he would aim for a negotiated withdrawal of Soviet troops,
even if the political aims for securing the regime had not been met.</p>
<p>A year later, Afghanistan was as much of a mess as it had been when
Gorbachev took over. The Soviet offensive had simply led to more
suffering for Afghan civilians, more refugees for the mujahedin to
recruit from, and higher numbers of Red Army casualties. It had also led
to more US, Chinese, and Pakistani support for the insurgents. In a move
that shocked even its British allies, the Reagan Administration had
supplied the Afghan Islamists with sophisticated portable ground-to-air
missiles, Stingers, that had a range of twenty-six thousand feet. Soviet
air operations had become much more risky. And a government victory on
the ground was not in sight. In June 1986, Gorbachev told the Politburo
that "we have to get out of
there."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en556en">^14^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en556}</p>

<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-540}In October 1986 Gorbachev met Reagan for a
summit in Reykjavik. The meeting had originally been suggested by the
Soviets as a preparatory meeting for a visit by Gorbachev to Washington.
But it turned into something much more substantial. Gorbachev had
decided to go all-out to break the dynamics of the arms race and prevent
the militarization of space. He offered an agreement to remove <em>all</em>
Superpower intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe, without
including British and French weapons. He also proposed a 50 percent cut
in intercontinental missiles. The condition was that the Americans did
not deploy SDI in any form for the next ten years. Taken aback, Reagan,
on his own initiative, proposed a deal to eliminate all ballistic
missiles within ten years. Gorbachev, almost immediately, suggested
eliminating all nuclear weapons within a decade.</p>
<p>But Reagan would not budge on SDI.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[<strong>R[EAGAN:]{.small-caps}</strong>] If we have eliminated all nuclear

:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-541}But Reykjavik was not entirely a failure.
The fact that Soviet and US leaders could now negotiate outside the
framework set by a generation of arms control talks pointed to a future
where even the most basic of Cold War concepts could change very
rapidly. The discussion, driven by the two leaders' political and
personal preoccupation with abolishing the risk of nuclear war, also
alerted their assistants that the Soviet-American conflict was moving
into a new phase with real opportunities for settling acute points of
conflict. Although most advisers on both sides were mightily relieved
that such a radical nuclear denouement was not achieved, at least not
there and then, they all understood that from now on they were in new
and entirely unchartered territory as to what could happen between the
two sides.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for Gorbachev's radicalism at Reykjavik was that he
wanted a big foreign affairs victory to underpin his new, more radical
initiatives at home. Throughout late 1986 Gorbachev and his advisers had
been working on new initiatives in what they called <em>perestroika</em>
(restructuring) and <em>glasnost</em> (openness). At a Central Committee Plenum
in January 1987 the general secretary announced that a fundamental
restructuring of the Soviet economy was necessary to overcome years of
deterioration. Perestroika, Gorbachev said, was "a resolute overcoming
of the processes of stagnation, destruction of the retarding mechanism,
and the creation of dependable and efficient machinery for expediting
the social and economic progress of Soviet society. The main aim of our
strategy is to combine the achievements of the scientific and
technological revolution with a plan-based economy and set the entire
potential of socialism in
motion."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en559en">^17^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en559}</p>
<p>But what was the concrete content of the restructuring to be? And how
much openness would be allowed? At the January plenum Gorbachev had
spoken about "free labor and free thought in a free country." But he had
also defended the Soviet past and the achievements of socialism.
Besides, there was intransigence and outright opposition to fundamental
reform within the Communist Party, the government, and not least the
economic planning system. During 1987 and 1988 Gorbachev and his closest
advisers, Aleksandr Iakovlev---a reformist former ambassador to
Canada---Vadim Medvedev, and Georgii Shakhnazarov, began formulating a
new strategy for the Soviet economy. In 1987 enterprises got more
autonomy to set their own production goals and to sell any surplus
production directly to consumers, but they also became responsible for
balancing their own budgets. The following year the Communist Party
allowed private ownership of businesses in some sectors, encouraged
joint enterprises with foreign companies, and supported the transfer of
control over some state-owned enterprises to workers' collectives.
Critics accused them of abandoning Communism. Gorbachev retorted that
what he did, and <em>only</em> what he did, would save Communism. Continuing as
before was simply not an option.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-542}Gorbachev undoubtedly had a point. After
oil prices fell by two-thirds from 1985 to 1986, the pressure on the
Soviet economy increased. Gorbachev's gamble was that new forms of
enterprise and foreign investments would make the economy grow, so that
dramatic cuts in state expenditure would not be necessary. But past
thinking was hard to avoid. High taxes discouraged enterprise.
Gorbachev's refusal to increase state-mandated prices on food and key
consumer goods kept shelves empty. The Central Bank kept printing money
to make up for the shortfall in state finances. As a result, inflation
rose and the black market became increasingly predominant in the cities.
Reforming the Soviet system, Gorbachev soon learned, was a gargantuan
task.</p>
<p>Some of the reform plans probably weakened the Soviet economy rather
than strengthening it. GosPlan, the previously all-powerful State
Planning Committee, was reduced to only "setting priorities," rather
than detailed planning of output at the factory level. By the late 1980s
this was almost certainly a necessary reform. But the haste and lack of
preparation with which it was implemented led to confusion and increased
the lack of interaction among production units that was necessary for
increasing output. By late 1988 the Soviet economy was changing fast.
But not all of it was for the better. And none of it, thus far,
contributed much to ordinary citizens feeling better off than they had
been before.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-543}Gorbachev's energy and appetite for change
seemed to know no boundaries. His policy of glasnost was originally
intended to open up criticism of previous practices in order to
stimulate support for perestroika. But soon the reduction in censorship
opened the floodgates for criticism of Communist principles and for
investigations of the crimes of the Soviet past. Gorbachev kept
insisting that there were limits to criticism and that only
"constructive" ideas should be put forward. But in reality he did very
little to limit the outpouring of recrimination that Soviet citizens had
pent up for so many years. Khrushchev, he believed, had been removed
because he had not had enough people to support him against party
conservatives. Exposing the misdeeds of the past would only strengthen
his own position. And, crucially for Gorbachev, he thought it was the
right thing to do. The more he learned about the true content of Soviet
repression, the more horrified he was by it.</p>
<p>In the Soviet press, cautiously at first, journalists began digging into
the secrets of the past. New accounts of the horrors of Stalin-era
prisoner camps were printed (prompting Gorbachev to release the last
remaining political prisoners and allow others to return from exile).
The 1930s purges were discussed openly, as was the woeful unpreparedness
of the USSR to withstand the German attack in 1941. But some of most
sensitive topics still took time to appear. The secret protocols of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in which the Nazis and the Soviets divided up
eastern Europe between them, were not admitted to before 1989. And it
took up to 1990 for Soviet responsibility for the massacre of Polish
officers at Katyn to be accepted. The Soviet government, Gorbachev then
said, "expresses deep regret over the tragedy, and assesses it as one of
the worst Stalinist
outrages."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en560en">^18^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en560} But
for some Soviets it was too much, too fast. In a letter to a newspaper
in March 1988, the chemistry professor Nina Andreeva deplored the new
tendencies. "Recently," she wrote, "one of my girl students puzzled me
by frankly saying that the class struggle was an antiquated conception,
like the leading role of the
proletariat."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en561en">^19^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en561}
Andreeva wanted the basic Marxist principles to be kept in place, and
many Soviet citizens, especially in Russia, agreed with her.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-544}For Gorbachev it was important, though,
that he and the party served <em>all</em> Soviet republics and not just Russia.
Believing that some of his reforms would be more popular in the
periphery than in the center, he and his closest advisers traveled much
around the country, including to the Caucasus and to central Asia.
Gorbachev also believed that the Soviet Union had to develop into a real
federal union of equal republics, and that these republics should be as
self-governing as possible. He kept telling his Moscow colleagues that
reform, and especially political reform, could only be guaranteed from
below, and that with the right kind of leadership much could be achieved
in and through the republics. By the end of 1988 some of the republics
had begun to assert themselves more than in the past, both in support of
reform and in support of their own interests.</p>
<p>Two entirely unforeseen events also contributed to the speeding up of
reform in the Soviet Union. In April 1986 reactor number four at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the Ukraine-Belorussian border
exploded, sending massive amounts of highly radioactive fallout into the
atmosphere. Through the heroic efforts of firefighters and military
personnel the ensuing fire was brought under control. But everything
else backfired. Authorities were slow in carrying out a general
evacuation of the population in the worst affected area. For two days
Soviet leaders said nothing about the accident. They only did so after
high levels of radiation were picked up in faraway Sweden. Gorbachev,
who had been unusually reticent himself as the crisis broke, later used
the Chernobyl example as a telltale of why glasnost was needed
throughout Soviet bureaucracy. For Soviet citizens, and for Europeans in
general, it was a stark reminder of the terrible environmental record of
the USSR.</p>
<p>A year after the Chernobyl disaster a German teenager, Mathias Rust,
managed to fly a small airplane undetected from Helsinki to Moscow, and
landed unopposed in the middle of Red Square. Rust said he did it for
the sake of peace. For the Soviet military it was a public relations
disaster. Gorbachev made use of the opportunity to pension off half the
general staff and promote people he believed in, such as Marshal Sergei
Akhromeev, a thinking man's general if there ever was one. But the idea
that the Red Army had created an impenetrable fortress lost some of its
luster, in Russia especially. Rather, the generals became the aim of a
new barrage of jokes. Groups of Russians, it was said, were now
loitering around Red Square waiting for the next flight to Hamburg. Or
that Red Square should be renamed Sheremetevo 3, since the new Terminal
2 at Moscow's Sheremetevo Airport was already crumbling.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-545}In eastern Europe people were watching in
disbelief as the Gorbachev phenomenon was unfolding. To begin with, most
people inside and outside the Communist parties believed that the
reforms would lead to the strengthening of Soviet power and therefore of
its hold on other countries. Even after Gorbachev himself began speaking
openly about the need for eastern European leaders to reform their own
countries, indicating that they would be allowed a great deal of leeway
in choosing their own path, he was widely disbelieved. Eastern Europeans
had seen periods of Soviet liberalization before and knew where they had
all ended. But by 1987 it began to dawn, first inside the Communist
parties, that Gorbachev was something completely new. For the party
members who wanted reform, Gorbachev seemed the answer to their dreams.
But for the party leaders, who feared change, perestroika and glasnost
were the stuff of nightmares. When Gorbachev's impish press secretary
Gennadi Gerasimov, in Czechoslovakia, was asked what was the difference
between Gorbachev's reforms and Dubček's in 1968, his response was
"nineteen years." Antireform Communists in eastern Europe had much to
fear.</p>
<p>For Gorbachev, what mattered most with eastern Europe was to fit the
states there into a more successful European socialist community, which
could rival the achievements the general secretary saw in the capitalist
western European Community. He wanted to learn from the practices of the
more advanced states, first and foremost the GDR, in terms of technology
and its implementation. But he was also aware that economically all
eastern European states got a good economic deal from cooperating with
the Soviet Union, especially in terms of energy and raw material prices
set far below world standards. Fairness meant that prices within the
Communist economic community, the ComEcon, should be similar to prices
in international markets, Gorbachev thought, and paid in hard currency.
Politically, the eastern Europeans should solve their own problems
within the Warsaw Pact and the ComEcon, while adhering to the
international policies of the USSR. In 1986, Gorbachev told East German
leader Erich Honecker that he should "do what he regards as right for
themselves, just like we do what we regard as right for us. It is best
if we have confidence in each
other."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en562en">^20^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en562} But the
Soviet leader's advice was that eastern European Communists needed to
broaden the base for their own rule, just like he was trying to do at
home.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-546}Although all East Bloc leaders paid
lip-service to the Soviet initiatives, in reality most of them tried to
stave off any meaningful change for as long as possible. They knew that
they could not liberalize their regimes without the risk of losing
control. Their hope was that perestroika and glasnost would stall or be
reined in inside the USSR. The relationship between Gorbachev and
Honecker soon soured. Gorbachev tired of the East German leader's
constant reminders of the need for the USSR to support the GDR. Honecker
also complained about less-than-flattering treatment of the GDR in
Soviet papers. When Reagan dared the Soviet leader to end the division
of Germany in a 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate---"Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall"---Gorbachev bristled. He told his advisers that he
would not let the Americans set his European policy. But even so,
Gorbachev's closest foreign affairs aide, Anatolii Cherniaev, wrote in
his diary, "He feels it in his heart that the problem cannot be removed
and that someday the Germans will
reunite."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en563en">^21^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en563}</p>
<p>What really galled Gorbachev was that East German intransigence
prevented him from doing what he considered really important for the
Soviet Union, not least economically: to draw closer to West Germany
and, through the Germans, to western Europe. Gorbachev had not given up
on the age-old Soviet Cold War dream of somehow politically detaching
the Europeans from the Americans. But as his economic needs grew,
especially for trade and credits, his priorities began to shift.
Gorbachev was aware that the West German economy was the dynamo at the
heart of the European Community, and also the source of much of the
credit that had flowed into eastern Europe. Not believing that the
United States would be a source of economic assistance, Gorbachev's
thinking concentrated more and more on West Germany and, perhaps in a
longer perspective, Japan.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-547}Still, it took up to late 1988 to arrange
a proper meeting between Gorbachev and West German chancellor Helmut
Kohl. East Germany was one big obstacle. Another was that Kohl feared
the influence Gorbachev could have in western Europe through his
enormous popularity there. "Gorbymania" in the West was at its peak in
1986--87. In West Germany, opinion polls showed that he was by far the
most popular figure in world politics, well ahead of Reagan, Kohl, and
Thatcher. In an offhand remark that really angered Gorbachev, Kohl in
1986 had said that the Soviet leader was only "a modern Communist leader
who understands public relations. Goebbels," added the chancellor
tactlessly, "... was an expert in public relations,
too."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en564en">^22^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en564}</p>
<p>Gorbachev's closest contacts in the West were with the two countries he
had visited as a tourist twenty years before, France and Italy. The
leaders there had experienced the moderation and political integration
of their own Communist parties into the national mainstream, and
therefore believed they could help socialize the Soviet Union into
status quo world affairs as well. The Italian leader Giulio Andreotti
and the French president François Mitterrand were probably among the
most cynical entrepreneurs of power in postwar Europe, but their
experience and insights fitted Gorbachev's purpose of learning more
about how the West actually operated. Margaret Thatcher, too, was a
favored interlocutor, even if the general secretary expected to get
less, both in terms of useful advice and support, from the prime
minister the Soviet press had dubbed "the Iron Lady."</p>
<p>Still, Gorbachev was realistic enough to understand that he needed to
concentrate on relations with the United States if he were to achieve
the two key breakthroughs he was looking for: nuclear disarmament and
reduction of military tension, both in Europe and elsewhere. In late
1987 the Soviet leader went to Washington for his first summit on US
soil. The official purpose was to sign a treaty on eliminating most
intermediate nuclear forces, such as the SS-20s and Pershings, in itself
a huge step forward for arms control. But the summit ranged much wider.
Gorbachev told Reagan about his plans for democratic government in the
USSR and spoke openly about his difficulties. The president was
impressed both with his dedication and with his frankness. He startled
Reagan by saying that the Soviet Union expected to withdraw fully from
Afghanistan within twelve months (although Gorbachev's appeals for the
Americans to stop arming the mujahedin fell on deaf ears). Above all he
got Reagan's attention when he declared that he would "like to work
together with the President to resolve regional conflicts." In
follow-ups from the summit the Soviets and the Americans for the first
time sat down to discuss how they together could work to draw down the
conflicts in Indochina, in southern Africa, and in Central America.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-548}After the Washington summit, the two sides
began to view each other, at least to a limited extent, as partners
seeking solutions to world problems. There was little doubt that the
Americans were in the driver's seat. The Soviets often took over US
positions or ameliorated them, at most. This reflected both genuine
changes in Soviet views of regional conflicts and a sense of weakness on
their side. Though under pressure toward the end of his presidency,
Reagan had nothing like the problems Gorbachev had at home. But also
just getting to know each other better actually did deliver results.
Military to military contacts flourished, during which the generals
discovered that some of their worst fears did not appear in the strategy
of the other side, or that some procedures were merely mirror images of
each other. Enemy stereotypes started to give way, although it was still
unclear what they would be replaced by. For some allies of both
countries, and especially for Soviet allies in Africa and Asia, the
process seemed to happen with bewildering, unnerving speed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-549}Only six months after the Washington
summit Ronald Reagan traveled to Moscow for the first visit to the
Soviet capital by a US president in sixteen years. Although the two
sides made progress on arms control and general bilateral relations, the
real breakthrough was in political atmospherics. At a speech at Moscow
State University, broadcast directly by Soviet television, Reagan lauded
the new relationship between the two sides. They were now partners and
friends, he said. "People do not make wars," Reagan argued, "governments
do. And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for
territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology. A people free to
choose will always choose
peace."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en565en">^23^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en565} When
asked by a reporter, as he walked across Red Square, whether he still
believed the Soviet Union was an evil empire, Reagan said, "No. You are
talking about another time, another
era."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en566en">^24^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en566} He put his
arm around Gorbachev and announced that "there is good chemistry between
us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en567en">^25^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en567}</p>
<p>Reagan's willingness to embrace the Soviet side did not extend to
regional conflicts, however. When Gorbachev tried to explain to him that
politics in Muslim countries was already moving from Cold War
confrontations to a risk of new fundamentalist regimes, Reagan refused
to listen. Gorbachev highlighted the dangers that existed in
Afghanistan. But, the general secretary continued with some relief,
"Afghanistan is now a thing of the past. We have reached our agreement.
Let's untie the Afghanistan knot and use it as a basis of untying other
regional knots." "The Soviet Union," Gorbachev said, "was willing to act
with the United States, but the US seemed uninterested or unwilling to
work
cooperatively."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en568en">^26^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en568}</p>
<p>Gorbachev was right that Afghanistan did not set a good precedent for
cooperation with the United States on regional conflicts. In April 1988
the Pakistanis and the Afghans had signed the Geneva Accords, guaranteed
by the USSR and the United States. All sides promised to respect
principles of sovereignty and noninterference, and the Soviets stated
that they would withdraw their troops no later than May 1989. Any
internal settlement was left up to the Afghans themselves. Washington
refused to stop arming the mujahedin, noting simply that "should the
Soviet Union exercise restraint in providing military assistance to
parties in Afghanistan, the United States similarly will exercise
restraint."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en569en">^27^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en569} It
was a sham of an agreement, which allowed the Afghan civil war to
continue as before, minus the presence of Soviet troops. But for
Gorbachev it was still a victory of sorts: it allowed him to bring the
soldiers home and to draw a line under the Afghanistan fiasco. The
withdrawal was completed by 15 February 1989, three months ahead of the
deadline.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-550}Gorbachev's supporters had hoped that the
Afghan settlement, if it could be called that, and Reagan's public
embrace of the Soviet leader in Moscow would give the general secretary
some slack in dealing with domestic affairs. That was not to be the
case. In late 1988 and early 1989 problems seemed to be peaking on the
home front, with food shortages in the cities and growing political
unrest in some of the republics. Much of the dissatisfaction was
concentrated on Gorbachev himself. He had promised so much and delivered
so little, many people thought. Some had already forgot that only a few
years earlier such sentiments openly expressed could have landed them in
prison or worse. Now, the reforms themselves seemed to be under threat
because the Soviet state was breaking apart at the seams.</p>
<p>The only leader who seemed undaunted by these difficulties was Gorbachev
himself. He spent much time in the winter of 1988--89 thinking about
political reform and the decentralization of power to the republics. In
March 1989 the Soviet Union held its first ever contested elections for
a new parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. The CPSU won in
most precincts, often by dubious methods, but about 20 percent of the
seats were won by independents. One of them was Andrei Sakharov, the
dissident physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who had been released
from internal exile only two years before. Another was the rebellious
Boris Yeltsin, a former Moscow party chief and member of the Politburo
who back in 1987 had threatened to resign in protest against the slow
pace of reform and as a consequence had been fired by Gorbachev. The
party's monopoly on power had been broken. And the breaking had been
designed by the man who was the Communist Party's general secretary and
the country's supreme leader.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-551}In his first years in power, Mikhail
Gorbachev had attempted to redraw the political map inside and outside
of the Soviet Union. To him, the Cold War no longer made sense, at least
not in its classical form of global confrontation and lack of
interaction. His starting point was Marxist-Leninist, or rather, Marxist
<em>and</em> Leninist. He believed in materialist analyses but also in the
ability of a small and determined minority to act on behalf of society
as a whole. And he found that the USSR needed to adopt some of the
practices of the West in order to retain and develop Soviet socialism.
Learning and adapting was not a sign of weakness, Gorbachev believed,
but a source of strength. His leadership qualities and the authority of
the Communist Party would make perestroika a success.</p>
<p>Three things happened domestically to undermine Gorbachev's project. The
Soviet economy took a turn for the worse, in part because of the
dislocation produced by uncertain reforms. Across the Soviet Union
people began turning against the party's hierarchical structures. And a
sizeable number of Soviet leaders, including some of Gorbachev's close
advisers, had begun losing faith in even the basic tenets of socialism.
The general secretary was caught between party conservatives, who wanted
stability and political control, and those who were willing to abandon
the party in order to pursue their own plans for the future of their
countries and for their own future. Gorbachev himself wanted political,
economic, and legal reform, but without throwing overboard the
achievements of Soviet socialism. His aim, increasingly openly
expressed, was a state ruled by law, in which the power of the party was
not removed but curtailed. In October 1988 Gorbachev told the Politburo
that "the reorganization of the apparatus is connected with the
formation of a rule-of-law state.... The entire structure of our society
and state must work on a legitimate basis, i.e., within the limits of
the law. No-one has the right to go beyond the boundaries of the law, to
break the law. And the most important violator... is sitting here, at
this table---the Politburo, and also the Secretariat, of the Central
Committee."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en570en">^28^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en570}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter020.xhtml#page-552}In his international policies Gorbachev
aimed to overcome the Cold War and move the Soviet Union closer to
western Europe and especially to European social democracy. In
conversations with the former West German chancellor Willy Brandt, now
head of the Socialist International, and with Spain's socialist prime
minister Felipe González, he admitted that "talking with you is both
easy and hard for us. Easy because the level of mutual understanding
allows us to communicate like friends, openly, discussing any subject.
But it is difficult because we cannot gloss over problems with general
phrases.... Perhaps," the general secretary told Willy Brandt in 1989,
"it is time to consider what needs to be done to overcome the schism of
1914."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en571en">^29^</a>{#chapter020.xhtml#en571} Gorbachev
saw his policies as part of Russia's age-old linking up with Europe, but
also as a coming together of socialists who had been split apart by
their responses to World War I, at the dawn of the Cold War ideological
conflict.</p>
<p>But Gorbachev's plans for an international reordering reached beyond
Europe. To him, getting rid of the Cold War meant more than a return to
concepts of state interest, of the sort that had existed in the late
nineteenth century, before the Cold War took hold. His vision was for a
better-organized world, in which the UN and comprehensive international
agreements regulated international affairs and prevented the kind of
indiscriminate killing that both sides had engaged in far too often in
regional conflicts during the Cold War. Given the US conviction that the
world at large was turning toward American concepts of freedom and free
market practices, Gorbachev's vision might seem naïve. But it was
another striking example of how, within the span of only a few years, a
vigorous leader had been able to redefine the very purpose of what the
Soviet state stood for and how Soviet power should be understood.

<h1 id="global-transformations-chapter-title"><a href="#toc.xhtml#toc-chapter021">Global Transformations</a> {.chapter-title}</h1>
<p>The world had changed tremendously in the 1970s and early 1980s, and in
the late 1980s it changed even more. New technologies began to transform
the way many people got information, did business, or thought about the
future. New forms of economic practices, centered on capital and
investment, spread worldwide. New centers of industrial production,
especially in Asia, began to take over some of the functions that Europe
and North America had developed for more than a century. And, as we have
already seen in the Soviet Union, political ideologies also began to
change, slowly at first, but then more and more rapidly. By the time the
Cold War ended, the world had already changed in ways that made the
global ideological conflict less relevant for a large number of people,
while other conflicts---ethnic, religious, national, or economic---had
become more important.</p>
<p>These late-twentieth-century global transformations implied many things
at once. In North America and Europe they meant the spread of market
practices less encumbered by social welfare provisions. As a result,
when these practices spread further, to countries in which they had so
far played less of a role for the individual---the Middle East, India,
China, southeast Asia---they were presented as inflexible and unceasing:
the harder edge of capitalism. The amazing spread of information through
film and television, including global news broadcasts and satellite
connections, confronted people with lives of alternatives and affluence
in forms few had seen before. To most people, obviously, the lifestyles
of <em>Dynasty</em> or <em>Baywatch</em> were quite literally undreamed of. But the
global spread of daytime television also helped to put in sharp relief
the lives that people actually lived across the globe. And by 1989 many
people wanted a better life for themselves and their families, over and
beyond what the great socialist and collectivist projects could offer.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-554}The information explosion contributed
significantly to the end of the Cold War, especially in the sense that
people's priorities shifted. But a better informed public is not always
a more knowledgeable one. Sometimes a sudden flourish of information
that immediately and demonstrably contradicts values you have long held
dear can lead to cynicism and callousness. Likewise, the breakdown of
social structures held in place by authoritarian leaders can create
dramatic redefinitions of purpose both within and among preexisting
communities. The world experienced all of this---from the Soviet Union
to Yugoslavia to China to Latin America---as the Cold War came to an
end. Although the conclusion of the global Cold War facilitated the
resolution of old confrontations, it also gave rise to new forms of
tension worldwide.</p>
<p>The global changes of the 1980s contributed to a general crisis for
socialist states. This was not just an eastern European crisis, it was
global, in the sense that new socialist states such as Nicaragua,
Ethiopia, Mozambique, or Vietnam also came under tremendous pressure to
modify or abandon their political choices. As we have already seen, some
of this came out of the global antirevolutionary offensive of the Reagan
Administration. But the crisis went deeper than that. And in many ways
the initial changes in socialist countries of the Global South
<em>preceded</em> the changes that took place in eastern Europe. China is of
course the big example. But even countries that were aligned with the
Soviet Union in the early 1980s began to introduce incentives and
markets into their economies. Mozambique is a case in point. By 1982--83
small-scale private enterprise was allowed. In 1986 the country signed a
deal with the International Monetary Fund, which, in return for loans
and investment, privatized major industries, reduced state spending, and
deregulated trade as well as the general economy. In Vietnam, the
government had already begun liberalizing trade and agricultural
production in 1981. By 1986, before there were any major changes in the
USSR and eastern Europe, Vietnam introduced the Đŏi Mői (Renovation)
program, which brought market principles to much of the economy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-555}These changes away from the plan and
toward the market happened at the same time as the beginning of a major
shift in the center of the world's economic activity from the North
Atlantic states to eastern Asia. This transition is a long process,
which is still ongoing. But its origins, at least in a full-scale form,
can be traced back to the decade before the Cold War ended. The shift
had many causes. The global spread of capital and technology was one.
Developments in transport and patterns of consumption were others. The
easy exploitation of reasonably well-skilled pools of labor under
authoritarian, market-friendly regimes in Asia also stimulated
capitalist growth. But perhaps most important was the unprecedented
access to markets in Western countries that made export-led models of
growth possible. And the latter was a direct consequence of the way the
Cold War was fought in its final stage, when the United States built
crucial alliances with Asian countries to keep the Soviet Union and its
allies at bay.</p>
<p>The massive expansion of global markets coincided with the expansion of
US power globally. Contrary to what many had thought in the 1970s (and
would think again in the 2010s), the reorientation of the world's key
nodes of industrial production away from the United States did little to
harm America's centrality in world affairs. Since many of the ideas,
practices, technologies, and products that spread worldwide were in
their origins <em>American</em>, the United States appeared to be more
important than ever. And the massive deficit spending the Reagan
Administration undertook, mainly for military purposes, stimulated both
domestic consumption and foreign investments in the United States. It
also, of course, expanded the American position as by far the most
powerful country in terms of its armed forces.</p>
<p>The US economic benefits from globalization would, in hindsight, stand
out as a moment more than a general trend. But it was enormously
significant because of the timing: the full extent of US global hegemony
was at its peak when the Cold War came to an end. This is, of course,
different from arguing that US power, pure and simple, ended the Cold
War. But the two are obviously related. The same global developments
that undermined the socialist countries and that made eastern Asia a hub
for the further expansion of capitalism also made the Reagan expansion
possible. And it was this expansion that convinced many, including
former enemies, that US economic practices on most things from
marketing, to corporate management, to financial (de)regulation were
worth emulating. The global transformations at the end of the Cold War
therefore seemed to privilege the United States in ways that former US
leaders could hardly believe was achievable.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-556}<strong>T[HE CLEAREST EVIDENCE]{.small-caps}</strong>
for the centrality of the United States could, ironically enough, be
found in China. After the Maoist regime had made anti-Americanism the
staple of its foreign policy and had broken with the Soviets to a large
extent because Khrushchev attempted to stabilize relations with the
Americans, Mao himself toward the end of his life began cooperating with
the United States to improve China's security. Deng Xiaoping, Mao's
successor as Chinese leader, took the cooperation with the Americans
much further than Mao in his wildest imagination would have thought
possible. Deng's aims were mostly economic. He believed that China's
technological backwardness weakened it and made it a more likely victim
for Soviet aggression. But he also wanted to improve the standard of
living for the Chinese people. As his plane took off for his first visit
to the United States in 1979, Deng instructed his advisers in what he
saw as a key lesson of the twentieth century: "Whoever work with the
Americans will gain, while those who try to oppose them will
fail."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en572en">^1^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en572}</p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping was born in 1904 in a small village in northeastern
Sichuan Province. He had worked in France in his youth, where he joined
the Communist Party, and later served the Comintern in Moscow. Back in
China he worked loyally with Mao Zedong, even though he admitted that he
found some of the Chairman's more recondite plans difficult to
understand. Purged twice as a "Rightist" during the Cultural Revolution,
Deng came back with a vengeance after Mao's death in 1976. A fiery man
with an iron work ethic, Deng had been dubbed "little red pepper" by his
workmates in France. This was not only because he stood barely five feet
tall and liked his home province's spicy cuisine; it was also because he
was, always, a man in a hurry, for himself and for his country. By 1978
the leaders of the Maoist Left, including the Chairman's wife, Jiang
Qing, had been arrested, and China put on a new course toward economic
reform.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-557}To begin with, Deng and his advisers had
few clear ideas about how to change China. What they did know was that
the past had been a disaster. The common realization of how bad things
were was in a way their most important weapon. Instead of catching up
with the advanced economies, China in the 1960s and '70s had fallen
further and further behind. It was as if all their efforts, all the
intensity of the political campaigns, all the willingness to sacrifice
for the common good, especially among young people, had led to nothing.
On his visit to the United States, Deng saw an affluence and abundance
that was almost beyond comprehension. He could not sleep at night, he
reported to his colleagues. The thought of how much China had to do to
catch up kept him awake.</p>
<p>Deng's greatest strength in moving China forward was his willingness to
experiment. And unlike Gorbachev in Moscow ten years later, the Chinese
leader had something to build on that was outside of the Plan. As
Communist authority fragmented during the Cultural Revolution, a few
communes and work collectives in the southern provinces had
clandestinely begun to introduce market mechanisms in their business
practices. They had done so not so much to earn lots of money but rather
out of sheer self-preservation. If the Maoist campaigns were to return,
they thought, they had to have something to live on. In the 1960s their
children had died of hunger. They were determined that should not happen
again. By 1974 some of these units had set up barter agreements and
indirect credit arrangements, as well as different forms of fee-charging
services. In border areas some units engaged in smuggling and currency
fraud. Some agricultural communes allowed families to sell produce they
had cultivated themselves, and keep the profit.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-558}This was the market as conscious rebellion
against a system that simply did not deliver. It was small-scale and
easily snuffed out. In cases when inspectors or zealots caught those
responsible, they could go to prison for years. But when the central
government, slowly and tentatively, began experimenting with market
concepts after 1978, these people were ready. With others who had
similar ideas, the <em>getihu</em> (private traders, or, perhaps better,
guerrilla entrepreneurs) began diversifying and investing. After 1981
many of their activities were legalized, even though for years some of
what they did was in a legal gray zone. Most of them did not mind, as
long as they could earn money without being threatened with prison or
execution.</p>
<p>In Beijing, China's reformist leaders did not make policy with these
people in mind, though the getihu represented the kind of dynamism that
some of them would like to see more of. Deng's reform plans had three
main aims: to get access to modern technology, to increase production,
and to keep the Communist Party in power unopposed. Under these main
aims, there were distinct subsections. Deng wanted to increase exports
(to earn hard currency) and strengthen the military (to guard against a
Soviet attack and keep the party in power). He also wanted to
decentralize economic decision-making. One of the key targets for Deng's
ridicule was the Beijing bureaucrat who now, safe from Cultural
Revolution upheavals, simply added another half percent to planned
output for each year.</p>
<p>But the road to reform was in no way straightforward. The party was
faction-ridden and politically divided. Many of Deng's colleagues, not
surprisingly, thought that models for socialist China should be sought
in socialist Yugoslavia or Hungary, not in the capitalist West. Allowing
private enterprise was especially difficult. The Chinese name for the
Communist Party, Gongchandang, literally means "the Party of Common
Property." Under Mao, party leaders had spent years denouncing market
experiments in other socialist countries. To now turn around and endorse
such practices in China was hard. But Deng drove them on. "We permit
some people and some regions to become prosperous first, for the purpose
of achieving common prosperity faster," he told CBS's Mike Wallace in
1986.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en573en">^2^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en573}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-559}Deng's first steps, beyond allowing
small-scale private enterprise in trade and services, was to
decollectivize agriculture. He dissolved the People's Communes and
introduced a household responsibility system. This meant that families
were allocated a plot of land from which they had to deliver a set
output to the state, but were free to trade any surplus privately.
Agricultural production shot up. Farmers started to save money.
Sometimes they pooled their money to start small enterprises in their
villages or the nearest town. State-owned enterprises were allowed to
sell surplus products and set their own prices for them. Foreign
investment was encouraged in special economic zones, where foreign
companies could invest freely and retrieve their profits, as long as
they were willing to share their technological know-how with Chinese
companies.</p>
<p>While Deng was a daring experimenter in economic policy, he was much
less certain in international affairs. He knew that he needed a good
relationship with the United States and linked Chinese foreign policy
closely to that of Washington. Having imbibed Mao's perception of the
Soviet Union as a deadly threat to China, Deng believed that working
with the Americans provided protection as well as economic
opportunities. And the United States was happy to oblige. For both
Carter and Reagan, China was the key Cold War ally, equal if not greater
in importance than western Europe or Japan. Having at first been shocked
at Chinese poverty and underdevelopment, the Americans assisted growth
through loans, technology transfers, and access to foreign markets. If
China was to work with the United States to put pressure on the Soviet
Union, then its domestic situation had to improve.</p>
<p>The beginning of the Chinese economic expansion, which later was to
produce such earthshaking consequences for the global economy as a
whole, was therefore intimately connected to how the Cold War was
fought. As the market took hold in China, and as the overall economy
began expanding, the Chinese attraction to Western, and especially
American, methods of production, management, and marketing also
increased. By the late 1980s, Chinese society was already a very
different place from the wearisome, terrorized setting it had been a
decade earlier. Some people suffered as social security provisions
faded. But more people wanted to make use of the new opportunities that
Deng's reforms offered. Even though most of the economy was still
state-controlled, and the Communist Party refused to give up its
monopoly on power, China had started a transformation that marked a
definitive break with socialist planning models. Its choices were
strongly to influence other socialist countries that wanted higher
growth through participation in the global economy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-560}Still, China was not the main focus of
those who looked for economic models for the future in the 1980s. Next
door, in Japan, an already developed economy was experiencing continuous
high growth rates of around 5 percent. At the beginning of the decade,
the Harvard social scientist Ezra Vogel had argued that Japan, in many
respects, was already the number one country globally. Japan, he argued,
"has dealt more successfully with more of the basic problems of
post-industrial society than any other
country."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en574en">^3^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en574}
Comparing the influence of global powers eight years later, the Yale
historian Paul Kennedy saw Japan as "enormously productive and
prosperous, and getting much more
so."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en575en">^4^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en575} It was hard
not to conclude that the future, at least in some ways, belonged to
Japan.</p>
<p>The argument that Japan had achieved its extraordinary position in spite
of (some would say because of) not prioritizing military affairs was
tremendously powerful in the debates of the 1980s. It implied that what
made countries successful in the late twentieth century was not military
power but economic achievement. It also implied that an export-led
process of economic growth could lift countries not just out of poverty,
but could help them to overtake the major powers of the world. In 1990
Japan's GDP per capita was higher than that of the United States, and
almost seven times higher than that of the USSR. Not surprisingly, other
countries wanted to learn from the Japanese model.</p>
<p>A main reason why Japan could concentrate on its own economic growth was
of course that the United States not only protected the country
militarily but also had facilitated its access to international markets,
first and foremost its own. And even though the Reagan Administration
publicly voiced its displeasure with Japan's trading practices, it was
very careful to not let economic issues endanger the close alliance
between the two countries. This was particularly true after Nakasone
Yasuhiro became Japanese prime minister in 1982. Nakasone wanted to keep
the US alliance in place but was more of a nationalist both in political
and economic terms than his Liberal Democratic Party predecessors. He
wanted to improve Japan's relations with China and the rest of mainland
Asia, not least to improve the prospects for Japan's exports if the
United States should prove less amenable as a market in the future. By
1987 Japan was China's largest trading partner and the second-biggest
foreign investor, after the United States. Japan also had extraordinary
importance for China as a supplier of loans and technology. No wonder
Deng Xiaoping underlined the importance of the relationship while
meeting with Nakasone. "The historical friendly relations between Japan
and China must continue onto the 21st century, and then to the 22nd,
23rd, 33rd, and 43rd century," Deng said. "Currently, Japan and China do
not have urgent problems. The development of Japan-China relations into
the 21st century is more important than all other
issues."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en576en">^5^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en576}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-561}But by the 1980s Japan and China were not
the only Asian economies that grew. Most impressive in terms of growth
were the east and southeast Asian "little tigers." In 1987 Hong Kong's
per capita GDP grew 12.1 percent, South Korea's 11.2 percent, Taiwan's
11 percent, and Singapore's 9.1 percent. All of them had market-oriented
economies and export-led industrial growth, with a strong element of
state guidance of the overall economy. In other words, they looked a bit
like Japan (even though all of them were different in their own ways)
but were very unlike the centralized planned economies of the socialist
world. None of the little tigers had been expected by economists to do
well in international competition; they had few resources and they were
far away from most of their markets. But the 1970s had positioned them
to take advantage of the changes in the global economy in the decade
that followed. They all had well-educated populations, low production
costs, and well-managed, ambitious companies. Their businessmen already
had commercial contacts in the United States and western Europe, with
which their countries had been allied in the Cold War. The little tigers
were well placed to roam.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-562}The little big tigers, South Korea and
Taiwan, also benefitted enormously from the social and political
stability created by successful transitions to democracy. Up to the late
Cold War era both had been military dictatorships supported, at least
indirectly, by the United States. Thousands of people had died in the
struggle for democratic rights. But as the Cold War waned and
international tension in the region declined, both South Korea and
Taiwan moved to forms of democratic government, the former in 1987 and
the latter four years later. The transitions were initiated by the
regimes themselves, in part because they believed that their countries
would be stronger if they were more democratic. Their gamble that
democracy would create better laws and institutions paid off. Both
countries are today among the wealthiest in the world.</p>
<p>With the exception of the city-state of Singapore, southeast Asia had
not benefitted much from the global changes of the 1970s. Part of the
reason was the ongoing wars in Indochina, where Vietnam went almost
straight from a war against the United States to a war against the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia. No other part of the world suffered more, and for
longer, as a result of Cold War conflicts. And the suffering there
continued into the 1980s, mainly as a result of Reagan's Third World
strategy. In one of the most perverse twists of the Cold War, the
remnants of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, who were fighting the
Vietnam-supported government in Cambodia, survived up to 1991 thanks to
US and Chinese backing. Hitting back at Vietnam for its alliance with
the Soviet Union was the main purpose of this nefarious partnership, but
it was also a way for Reagan to tell the Chinese that he was serious
about containing the Soviets on the ground. The result was more misery
for the Cambodians, and also an undeclared border war between Vietnam
and Thailand, from where most of the Cambodian opposition operated.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-563}The perceived threat from a heavily
militarized Vietnam made the anti-Communist countries in southeast Asia
pull more closely together. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), which had been set up in 1967, aimed at ensuring "their
stability and security from external interference in any form or
manifestation in order to preserve their national identities in
accordance with the ideals and aspirations of their
peoples."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en577en">^6^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en577} But in
reality this had meant working closely with the United States against
what the leaders of these countries saw as Soviet and Chinese threats.
In the 1980s, however, Deng Xiaoping managed to turn generations of
distrust between China and conservative southeast Asian leaders around.
As the economic interaction between China and southeast Asia grew, the
diplomatic relationship also became closer. By 1985 it was clear that
Vietnam was facing coordinated pressure from the north and the south to
withdraw from Cambodia.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese leadership's response to this challenge was to deepen
reform at home and to prepare to end its military presence in the
neighboring countries. Even before Gorbachev was elected in the USSR,
the new generation of leaders in Hanoi realized that the Soviet Union
would only be of limited value to them in standing up to foreign
pressure. The Đ<img alt="image" src="images/Art_omac.jpg" />i
M<img alt="image" src="images/Art_oacute.jpg" />i reforms, which liberalized the
Vietnamese economy in the late 1980s and gave significant room for
private enterprise, was built on Deng's experiments in China but even
more so on the experience of the main ASEAN countries. In a move
unprecedented for any Communist state, Vietnam increasingly based its
negotiations for a withdrawal from Cambodia on the need to draw closer
to ASEAN. The first meetings were held in Jakarta, and by 1989 the
Vietnamese had made it clear that they would withdraw unilaterally
irrespective of the squabbling among the various Cambodian factions. By
September 1989 all Vietnamese forces had left. By 1992 Vietnam had a
Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with ASEAN and had also normalized its
relations with China.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s India also began to step further away from the Cold
War. Granted, India had always been an uncomfortable customer at the
Cold War table, intent on setting its own rules for its foreign
engagements. But since the 1960s it had increasingly come to see its
links with the Soviet Union as important to its national security. When
Indira Gandhi returned to power in 1980, she began a gradual loosening
of the ties to Moscow. Part of this was in response to the renewed
intensity of the Cold War. Gandhi did not want India to be seen as too
tied to the USSR as matters heated up. In spite of her abhorrence of
Islamism and sympathy with the secular reform aims of the Communist
Afghan government, she was uneasy at the effects of the Soviet invasion.
In particular, the Indian prime minister was concerned with the
unprecedented US support for Pakistan that the invasion produced. In her
meetings with President Reagan in 1982, Gandhi went out of her way to
stress that India wanted good relations with the United States, and that
she wanted the Soviets to withdraw from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-564}But India's new rebalancing of its foreign
relations came up against Reagan's insistence on providing ever more
advanced military aid to Pakistan. After Indira Gandhi was assassinated
in 1984, the new prime minister, her son Rajiv Gandhi, began seeing
Gorbachev as the answer to India's foreign policy dilemmas. Here was a
new Soviet leader who deemphasized strict ideological concerns and
placed economic development at the core of his foreign policy agenda.
Rajiv Gandhi saw, earlier than most, some of the transformation of the
global economy that was going on, and wanted India to go through its own
perestroika, giving more room to markets, private initiative, and
economic globalization. He believed Gorbachev to be a kindred spirit.
The Delhi Declaration the two signed in 1986 shows more Indian influence
than Soviet:</p>
<p>::: top
1. In the nuclear age, mankind must develop a new political thinking
and a new concept of the world that provides sound guarantees for the

<p>2. The world we have inherited belongs to present and future

values.</p>
<p>3. Human life must be acknowledged [as] the supreme value.</p>
<p>4. Non-violence must become the basis of human
co-existence.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en578en">^7^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en578}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-565}Though Gorbachev and Gandhi may have been
right that the abolition of the Cold War would lead to a more peaceful
world, other events in Asia did not exactly point in that direction. The
war between Iraq and Iran that broke out in 1980 has been called the
first post--Cold War war, and this is correct as far as the lack of
ideological motives are concerned. The Iraqi attack on Iran was largely
motivated by the prospect of territorial gain and the fear of Iranian
collusion with Iraq's minority Shia Muslims. The Soviets, who had been
big supporters of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, told the Iraqis they did not
see much sense or meaning in the war. Moscow was afraid that the Iraqi
attack would push Iran back into the arms of the United States. The
Reagan Administration, on the other hand, did not warm to either of the
two belligerents, though it was more concerned about the prospects of
Iranian expansion than anything Saddam was doing. One Administration
official is said to have quipped that it was a pity that both sides
could not lose. Meanwhile the war developed into a form of confessional
conflict, with Sunni Arabs battling Shia Persians. Almost a million
people died in a needless, aimless struggle, in which the two sides took
turns in having the upper hand and the only people to prosper were
European and Asian arms manufacturers.</p>
<p>The slow end to the Cold War brought little but misery to the Middle
East. In Africa the situation was very similar to begin with, but ended
with some rays of hope. Since the 1960s Superpower interventionism,
projects of European racial supremacy, and misguided high modern
development concepts had wreaked havoc with the continent. For most of
the 1980s this situation continued. In southern Africa the white
supremacist regime in South Africa continued to wage war against its
neighbors and oppress the black majority. The United States assisted the
survival of the regime through trade and investment, and by opposing
international sanctions. In Zaire (Congo) Mobutu continued his rampant
exploitation of his own people, supported through a Cold War partnership
with Washington. And in Ethiopia the officers of the Dergue clung to
their project of socialist transformation, assisted by the USSR, while
their country slowly fell to pieces around them. Elsewhere, military
dictatorships abounded. Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings took power in Ghana in
1979, aged thirty-two. Master Sergeant Samuel Doe did the same in
Liberia the following year, aged twenty-nine. It was not a pretty
picture.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-566}In southern Africa the situation was
especially acute. After their debacle in Angola in 1975--76, where they
were defeated by a combination of local and Cuban forces, the apartheid
regime in South Africa withdrew into the areas it controlled militarily.
The new prime minister, P. W. Botha, was a racial ideologue, who
believed that white South Africa was better off the less contact it had
with the rest of the continent. For him, the <em>vesting Suid-Afrika</em>
(fortress South Africa) was what was important, not what his supporters
disparagingly termed "civilizing blacks elsewhere." In 1979 Botha helped
the British and Americans push the white settler regime in Rhodesia to
accept the Lancaster House Agreement, by which the country became
majority-governed Zimbabwe in 1980. Their assumption, later proved
correct, was that the election winner, Robert Mugabe, was more intent on
establishing his own power than risking it through any form of
cooperation with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On other matters, internal and external, the Cold War became
increasingly important in southern Africa in the 1980s. Botha viewed his
own regime as essentially anti-Communist. His argument for clinging to
the fiction of "independent" homelands for blacks within South Africa
was that majority rule would mean a victory for Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress (ANC), which was in alliance with the South African
Communist Party. South Africa also continued to occupy the neighboring
country of Namibia (also known as South West Africa), in spite of
countless UN resolutions demanding its withdrawal. Meanwhile, Botha
stepped up the policy of trying to destabilize the next-door countries
of Angola and Mozambique, on the pretext that they were allied with the
Soviet Union and gave refuge to ANC exiles. The South African military
carried out hundreds of incursions into the territory of neighboring
states, with the explicit aim of killing leaders of the ANC resistance
or soldiers of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).
Southern Africa seemed to be a powder keg ready to explode.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-567}Besides South Africa itself, Angola was
the center point of the Cold War in Africa. The MPLA government that had
taken power with Cuban help in 1975 was closely allied with Havana and
Moscow. Although the South African regime seemed ready to live with that
as a fact, the Reagan Administration's support for the Angolan
opposition led to a flaring up of the civil war there. The leader of the
opposition UNITA movement, Jonas Savimbi, was one of the poster boys of
Reagan's antirevolutionary offensive in the postcolonial world. By 1984
Savimbi's guerrillas were receiving money, weapons, and training from
the CIA. As Reagan put it to his advisers the following year: "We want
Savimbi to know that the cavalry is
coming."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en579en">^8^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en579} In 1986
the Americans even supplied UNITA with fifty anti-aircraft Stinger
missiles. The fact that UNITA was allied with the South Africans and was
responsible for massive human rights violations in the areas it
controlled did not matter to Reagan. The important thing was to use the
conflict to put further pressure on the Soviets and on the Cubans to
withdraw from Africa.</p>
<p>P. W. Botha was a reluctant participant in Angola's renewed civil war.
He cherished the idea of destabilizing the regime in Luanda, but was
worried about trusting the Americans or engaging too many of his own
troops. What tipped the balance was the increased warfare in South
African--controlled Namibia. To alleviate the pressure on themselves,
the Angolan government had allowed SWAPO guerrillas to increase strikes
from Angolan territory into their homeland. In 1987 Botha decided to
teach the MPLA a lesson, while helping UNITA, which was on the defensive
in spite of recent US aid. The South African invasion quickly turned
into a stalemate. In the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale---the largest
military engagement in Africa since World War II---Cuban and Angolan
troops held their own against the advancing South African forces. Inside
South Africa public opinion quickly turned against the war, especially
after Botha had to call up the reserves in early 1988. Even to white
South Africans, Botha's regime increasingly seemed to deliver little but
war, instability at home, and continued international isolation.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-568}To many observers, both in Africa and
elsewhere, it seemed strange that the Reagan Administration continued to
fan the flames of war in southern Africa while talking peace with the
Soviets in Moscow. To some extent this difference in policy was the
result of real divisions within the Administration, with key State
Department officials pushing for negotiations to end regional conflicts
while many NSC staffers continued to emphasize covert operations in
support of anti-Communists. But it is doubtful whether the president
himself perceived it as a split in policy. For Reagan, forcing the
Soviets and Cubans out of Africa had always been a key aim. In his view,
Gorbachev could only become a US partner if he agreed to a full
withdrawal from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Reagan's approach was
maximalist: he wanted to benefit as much as possible from Soviet
weakness when the opportunity was there.</p>
<p>After Cuito Cuanavale, all sides in the Angolan conflict began slowly to
edge toward a negotiated solution. The improved relationship between the
United States and the Soviet Union played a decisive role. Both sides
pushed their allies toward an agreement. On the US side, Reagan was
under increasing pressure from Congress, which had already imposed
comprehensive sanctions on South Africa against the president's wishes.
The two diplomats in charge of coordinating Soviet-US cooperation on
Africa, Chester Crocker and Anatolii Adamishin, also hit it off
personally. Crocker played "a brilliant role," according to
Adamishin.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en580en">^9^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en580} In
December 1988 the parties reached a linked agreement on Cuban withdrawal
from Angola and Namibian independence.</p>
<p>The southern African agreement was a high point in dismantling Cold War
conflict in the Third World. It would of course not have been possible
without years of careful work through the UN and in international public
opinion by those who opposed the apartheid regime. It would also have
been unlikely without the Cubans matching South African military power
at Cuito Cuanavale. But in essence it symbolized Gorbachev's commitment
to a withdrawal from the Third World. "I personally don't think they are
going to build socialism in this part of the world," admitted Adamishin
at the signing of the accords. Fidel Castro went along with the process,
in part because he believed Cuba had achieved what it had sought in
southern Africa all along: security for Angola and independence for
Namibia. But he resented the manner in which the Soviets had acted above
his head, and expressed his concern in letters to Gorbachev. The Soviet
leader's key foreign policy adviser Anatolii Cherniaev was scathing:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-569}"The Beard" [Castro] wasted the
revolution and now he is ruining the country, which is spiraling toward
a total mess. It's true that he will not stop in his demagoguery about
orthodox Marxism-Leninism and going "to the end"; since this is the last
thing he can use to preserve his "revolutionary halo." But this halo is
already a myth.... Nobody reckons with Cuba in South America, it is no
longer setting any kind of example. The Cuban factor has waned. A break
in relations?... he is only going to harm himself. We will only win, and
save 5 billion doing it. Are people going to grumble about this? Yes,
some will: the dogmatists and dissenters from the "revolutionary camp"
and the Communist Parties that are becoming extinct, whose time has
passed.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en581en">^10^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en581}
:::</p>
<p>Against Cherniaev's advice, Gorbachev decided to go to Cuba to see
Castro in April 1989. With the southern Africa deal done, neither side
found it useful to rehash their differences over that event. Instead
Castro, who knew how dependent his regime was on Soviet support, took
the initiative in discussing a solution to the crisis in Central
America. He knew that Gorbachev would like to see such a solution, which
was one of the key concerns of the new US Administration of George H. W.
Bush. But Castro also hoped that Cuba would be able to extricate itself
before it was left alone in support of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and
their revolutionary allies in Central America as Soviet assistance
waned. Castro had always been a skeptic about the chances of survival
for Left-wing regimes in Central America without some kind of settlement
with the United States. As the Cold War receded, the Cuban leader hoped
that such an arrangement could be found.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-570}The Sandinista government in Nicaragua had
been fighting for its life against a US-led onslaught since the early
years of the revolution. Not only did the United States arm, train, and
equip Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries (the Contras), but it also
attempted to strangle the country economically through preventing
Nicaraguan exports. The ostensible reason for US hostility, the way
Reagan portrayed it, was Nicaraguan support of Left-wing guerrillas in
neighboring El Salvador, who were fighting the military and paramilitary
Right-wing groups. El Salvador---one of the most socially unequal and
politically unstable countries in Latin America---would probably have
seen massive unrest even if there had been no Nicaraguan support for the
Left. But Reagan used the El Salvador crisis to put further pressure on
the Sandinistas.</p>
<p>Reagan's problem was that the US intervention in Central America was far
from popular among Americans, who were weary of a Vietnam-like scenario
closer to home. A 1984 poll showed that only 30 percent supported
Reagan's policy
there.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en582en">^11^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en582} The
massive human rights violations of the Salvadorian military also harmed
the Administration's attempts at supporting them against Left-wing
guerrillas. The murder of the antiregime Salvadoran archbishop Oscar
Romero, as he celebrated mass in the San Salvador cathedral in 1980, was
an atrocity too far for many Americans, as was the killing, by sniper
fire, of thirty-five mourners at his funeral. Throughout the 1980s,
Reagan had to fight Congressional attempts to cut all US aid to the
Contras and to the Salvadoran government. By the time the Iran-Contra
scandal broke, in the fall of 1986, it was clear that the president
would not be able to fund his Central American campaign much longer
without serious conflict with US lawmakers. Reagan still persisted, but
his efforts were less and less effective, both with regard to US public
opinion and toward the fighting parties in Central America.</p>
<p>Indicative of how the Cold War ended, it was initiatives by regional
groups of countries that finally began resolving the civil wars in
Central America. Mexico, as the biggest country in the region, played a
key role, but it was Costa Rica's president Óscar Arias who in 1988
presented the peace plan that would underpin negotiated solutions. When
Castro and Gorbachev met in Havana in February 1989 this was, in effect,
the plan they chose to support. The Sandinistas had little choice but to
go along, as had the Contras, whom Congress threatened with losing all
support if they did not agree to lay down their weapons in exchange for
free and fair elections to be held in 1990.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-571}While the end of the decade brought some
hope for the peoples of Central America, the situation in Latin America
as a whole during the 1980s was contradictory and confusing. The region
as a whole saw a series of dramatic ends to years of military
dictatorships and a gradual return to civilian rule. In Peru in 1980,
Bolivia in 1982, Uruguay in 1984, and Brazil in 1985, new governments
were elected. In Argentina the military junta, which had been guilty of
countless human rights violations in the name of anti-Communism and the
Cold War, collapsed in the wake of their attempt to seize the Falklands
in 1982. Even Chile, where a ruthless military government under Augusto
Pinochet had been in place since the 1973 coup, was transformed in 1988
when the dictator lost what was intended to be a mere pro forma
referendum on his continued rule. Pinochet's Cold War rhetoric against
the Left no longer impressed the Chilean middle classes. Like middle
classes elsewhere, they sought stability, legality, and international
recognition. Pinochet's regime could not deliver any of these standards.</p>
<p>Pinochet's fall was surprising to his supporters in Washington. They
believed that in spite of the regime's brutality, Pinochet would be
forgiven by the majority because of the market-oriented economic reforms
his advisers had carried out. But like almost all Latin American
countries, whatever their economic orientation, Chile had turned out to
be profoundly susceptible to the international debt crisis of the early
1980s. During the previous decade, governments in Latin America had
borrowed heavily to finance economic expansion and public investments,
especially in infrastructure and education. Many countries of different
ideological persuasions, such as the Right-wing military dictatorship in
Brazil, the radical nationalist dictatorship in Peru, and the
semidemocratic government in Mexico, had aimed at centrally planned,
state-led industrialization processes. State-owned companies were at the
forefront of this expansion. By the early 1980s there were more than six
hundred state enterprises in Brazil, making up almost half of all bigger
companies. In Mexico there were more than a thousand, a fivefold
increase since the early 1970s. Even though many of these companies did
reasonably well in commercial terms (especially, of course, those that
were monopolies or near monopolies), they were dependent on massive
amounts of capital for their expansion, according to plans set by the
governments.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-572}Until the early 1980s, the international
lending market continuously expanded. The influx of hard currency
deposits from oil-rich Middle Eastern countries to Western and Japanese
banks, the so-called petro-dollars, made for easy money. And, for most
of the decade, the return through interest or investments in Europe or
the United States was low, thereby privileging more risky but also more
potentially rewarding lending to developing countries, especially in
Latin America. But in 1979 interest rates in the United States increased
dramatically, in some cases going up to 20 percent, a fourfold hike in
less than two years. At the same time instability in raw material
prices, on which most Latin America economies still depended, grew
further. These fluctuations, within a long-term downward trend, made it
more difficult either to pay back loans or get new ones. By 1982 many
big banks refused to lend more. In August that year Mexico defaulted on
its debts. This set off a chain reaction, in which the US government
scrambled to prop up the banks, while pushing for debt negotiations
among the debtor countries, the banks, and the international financial
institutions, especially the IMF.</p>
<p>For the Reagan Administration, the Latin American defaults were not only
the result of Latin profligacy and waste; they were also welcome
opportunities to spread the gospel of free markets and neoliberal
economies. The price the IMF exacted for helping Latin American
restructure their debt was called "structural adjustment," meaning the
recipient countries accepted neoliberal elements in their domestic
economies, such as privatization, import liberalization, and abolishing
subsidies and social spending. The short-term results were catastrophic
for the Latin American economies. Economic growth stagnated. Incomes
dropped, especially in urban areas, and unemployment rose to very high
levels. Inflation hit the middle class and working class alike. The only
good outcome of what Latin Americans call La Década Perdida (the Lost
Decade) was the collapse of the military dictatorships, which, by common
consent, had helped cause the economic meltdown and did not have the
power to stand up against US demands.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-573}The moves away from dictatorship and
toward more accountable forms of government in many parts of the world
at the end of the Cold War were much helped by invigorated international
debates on rights and norms. Many of these debates questioned the strong
and in some places almost overwhelming role of the state in Cold War
politics. The Cold War had helped states to expand their power over
people and communities almost everywhere. Even in the United States,
where so many ideological positions privileged individual freedoms and
rights, the practice had been toward an enlargement of the capacity of
the federal government. The argument, everywhere, had been won by the
combined needs of military preparedness and social improvement. The
former was to fend off enemy expansion. The latter was to organize
society better and to present it as the model for the future. But by the
1980s these forms of thinking were coming under pressure both in the
East and the West. In the Soviet Union, Gorbachev began to reconsider
the established belief that more state power was the solution to all
problems. In the United States and Britain neoliberals challenged the
very foundation that postwar state interventionism was built on: that
capitalism functioned better if it was regulated by governments. While
before the state seemed to be the answer (or at least a part of it),
now, for some, it was the mother of all ills.</p>
<p>But the shift in thinking was not only connected to economic or social
issues. It also dealt with human rights and legal protections for the
individual. And most surprisingly, perhaps, nongovernmental
organizations and pressure groups often took the lead in pushing states,
of both ideological persuasions, to respect such rights and norms.
Amnesty International, which had existed since 1961, expanded its
membership dramatically from the late 1970s on. Other groups, such as
Human Rights Watch and Helsinki Watch, appeared in the wake of the 1975
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Campaigns against the
human rights violations of Latin American dictatorships, such as Chile
or Argentina, grew in the region itself as well as in western Europe and
North America. In some cases, the campaigners were the same young people
who had protested against Soviet attempts at silencing its domestic
opposition. They celebrated the physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife
Elena Bonner, who had helped set up a group to monitor their country's
compliance with the Helsinki Accords in Moscow in 1976. These were
important signs that the Cold War divide was, at least to some people,
becoming less important than universal rights and duties. Dissidents in
Czechoslovakia or Poland could count on increasing support across the
political spectrum in the West. Meanwhile, other identities manifested
themselves in protests for basic rights. In Catholic Poland as well as
in Protestant East Germany, Christian churches affirmed the rights of
their countrymen as citizens. In Muslim countries clerics began to speak
out against unlawful imprisonments. "Rights talk" seemed, at least for a
while, to overtake the insistence on Cold War ideological rectitude.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-574}Nothing exemplifies the shifts in the
political terrain better than the success of the international campaigns
to end apartheid in South Africa. For years the main Western countries,
and especially the United States and Britain, had turned a mostly deaf
ear to protests against the blatant forms of racism through which the
white minority there ruled. South Africa was too strategically important
and too mineral rich to be put beyond the pale. More often than not,
Western leaders had felt a certain empathy with white South Africans,
even though they objected to the methods they used to rule the black
majority. But by the mid-1980s, as global protests spread against the
injustice with which South Africa was ruled, the policy of "constructive
engagement" with white South Africa came under increasing pressure.
While the UN demanded economic sanctions and an embargo against South
Africa, the international anti-apartheid movement got increasing
attention for its cause. The 1988 pop concert at Wembley Stadium in
London to celebrate the seventieth birthday of imprisoned ANC leader
Nelson Mandela became a global sensation, watched live by more than six
hundred million people around the world. Featuring a stunning array of
artists, from the Bee Gees to Whitney Houston and Eric Clapton, the
event made it more difficult to condemn Mandela as a "Communist," as
both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had done in the past. By the
end of the 1980s, even those who had shown sympathy with the South
African government in the past were turning against it, accepting that
the abolition of apartheid was a common task across Cold War boundaries.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-575}1980s "rights talk" was connected to the
other emerging global discourse, which could be called "identity talk."
With the Cold War ideological divide receding, more and more groups
reacted against states that had ignored individual and group identities,
be it along religious, linguistic, or ethnic lines. While human rights
activists spoke about universal principles, nationalists or religious
activists spoke about rights and duties embedded in them on behalf of
their communities. The state they lived in had suppressed these
communities, went the argument, and now they needed to reassert
themselves. In some cases, such as among Basques or Catalans in Spain,
or in the Baltic republics in the USSR, the Cold War was seen as having
been an argument for their suppression. In other cases, the Cold War was
seen as a kind of emergency, a frozen world that kept states together
well beyond their "sell by" date. The most striking example was the
federal republic of Yugoslavia, where centrifugal forces were soon to
cause disastrous results. Even the Serbs, the largest population group
in Yugoslavia, worried about their future. In a 1986 memorandum, the
Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences said,</p>
<p>::: blockquote
Unlike national minorities, portions of the Serbian people, who live in
other republics in large numbers, do not have the right to use their own
language and alphabet, to organize politically and culturally, and to
develop the unique culture of their nation. Considering the existing
forms of national discrimination, present-day Yugoslavia cannot be
considered a democratic state.... The guiding principle behind this
policy has been "a weak Serbia, a strong Yugoslavia" and this has
evolved into an influential mind-set: if rapid economic growth were
permitted the Serbs, who are the largest nation, it would pose a danger
to the other nations of Yugoslavia. And so all possibilities are grasped
to place increasing obstacles in the way of their economic development
and political
consolidation.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en583en">^12^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en583}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-576}But the main region for a massive shift
from a Left-Right divide to a new form of politics was in the Middle
East. There the Islamist revolution in Iran had provided inspiration for
new groups based on religious identity and on a new, political and
fundamentalist interpretation of the Quran. Up to the early 1980s
political interpretations of Islam, both Sunni and Shia, had mainly
identified with the Cold War political Right. The Sunni Muslim
Brotherhood, for instance, was a profoundly conservative organization
that battled the Middle Eastern Left, whether Communist, socialist, or
Ba'athist. But during the 1980s Islamists increasingly turned against
both socialism and capitalism, and against both the Soviet Union and the
United States. Egyptian and Saudi extremists played an important role in
this turn. For them, the United States was at least as guilty in helping
infidel Arab regimes suppress real Muslims as was the Soviet Union. They
wished to wage war against Israel and its American supporters. But they
also wanted to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. One of them,
Abdullah Azzam, a Palestinian Islamist who headed a key Pakistan-based
support network for the Afghan mujahedin, argued that "whoever can, from
among the Arabs, fight jihad in Palestine, then he must start there.
And, if he is not capable, then he must set out for Afghanistan. For the
rest of the Muslims, I believe they should start their jihad in
Afghanistan.... The sin upon this present generation, for not advancing
towards Afghanistan, Palestine, the Philippines, Kashmir, Lebanon, Chad,
Eritrea, etc., is greater than the sin inherited from the loss of the
lands which have previously fallen into the possession of the Kuffar
[the
infidels]."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en584en">^13^</a>{#chapter021.xhtml#en584}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-577}By the time the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan got underway, networks of internationalist Islamists were
being formed in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan. Osama
bin-Laden, a Saudi who was a sometime collaborator and sometime rival of
Azzam, organized his own group, which he called al-Qaeda (the Base).
Bin-Laden had been allied with the Afghan Islamist radicals Abdul Rasul
Sayyaf and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who---while receiving plentiful weapons
and supplies from the United States---had turned increasingly
anti-American. Like Azzam, bin-Laden and his sponsors saw Afghanistan as
just one battle in the war to liberate Muslims from foreign control. But
taking Kabul, the capital, was first on their list of priorities, and
with the Soviet pullout in 1989 they believed that their time had come.</p>
<p>Even without the Red Army, the Islamist conquest of Afghanistan turned
out to be more complicated than the somewhat naïve jihadists first
believed. Facing its moment of truth, the Afghan Communist government
fought better than its opponents. Even if Washington and the Pakistanis
continued their support for the mujahedin, while the Soviet Union
gradually ended most of its involvement, the opposition was not able to
take Kabul. Some local Afghan leaders found, not surprisingly, that they
feared the more radical Islamists and their foreign jihadi friends more
than they feared Najibullah's government. As their offensives failed,
the mujahedin started to fragment. By 1991, when the Communists finally
started running out of supplies, there was already a full-blown civil
war among some of the opposition groups. The mujahedin's final rush
toward Kabul in April 1992 saw Afghanistan descend into total chaos.
Hekmatyar, who wanted to take the city on his own, clashed with a
coalition of other factions, including some of his former Islamist
friends, and lost. His response was to shell the capital using heavy
artillery he had taken from the former government forces. It was an
unedifying spectacle, leading to a US disengagement and the despair of
foreign Islamists. For Osama bin-Laden the Afghan debacle was an
important lesson. Only through ideological training, committed
internationalism, and strict organization could the cause of jihad be
furthered in the future, he believed. Bin-Laden set out for Sudan but
was to return to Afghanistan, and to history, five years later.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter021.xhtml#page-578}The processes that ended the Cold War were
manifold and complex, just like its origins had been. The end of the
global conflict created enormous opportunities for good, as witnessed in
southern Africa or southeast Asia. But not all issues were resolved, and
some regional legacies lingered, such as in Korea, in the Middle East,
or in the Balkans. Sometimes the outcome was contradictory. The economic
hardships imposed on many Latin Americans often outweighed the
celebrations over the return to more democratic and responsive forms of
government. And some of the ideologies that overtook the Cold War
dichotomy, religious fanaticism or nationalist self-obsession first
among them, were as dangerous for the people caught up in them as the
ideological struggles between capitalism and socialism had been. Still,
the end of the Cold War opened up new possibilities for people
everywhere. In some cases they made use of them to make a better world.
This is not least true for Europe, the continent where the Cold War
arguably began and where it was to end.

<p>The Cold War in Europe ended because years of closer association between
East and West had reduced the fear that the two sides had for each
other, and because of western Europe's proven record of successfully
integrating peripheral countries into a European Community. It ended in
1989 because the peoples in eastern Europe rebelled and Gorbachev did
nothing to save the Communist regimes. On the contrary, the Soviet
leader insisted that popular sovereignty was unavoidable both in eastern
Europe and in the Soviet Union itself. The eastern European regimes had
shown that they could not reform. Therefore, the head of the CPSU found,
it was not unnatural for them to fall. It was a remarkable turn of
events, but one that had its portents in the beginning transformations
of the détente era. The end of Communism could happen so quickly in
Europe because the ground had already been laid and because the support
of the regimes in the East was already wafer-thin. Unless the Soviets
would act to rescue them, they could not defend themselves successfully.</p>
<p>By 1989, Gorbachev insisted that to him the Cold War was over. His
attention was increasingly being drawn to how to deepen reform within
the Soviet Union itself. His main preoccupation was with political
changes. Gorbachev wanted to make the USSR a democratic, federal state
and to pull the Communist Party, which he still headed, along in the
process. But his lofty aims were quickly overtaken by economic
hardships, nationalisms, and competing bureaucracies. With Gorbachev
refusing to budge, and without substantial aid coming in from elsewhere,
the Soviet state was soon in serious trouble. By 1991 its very existence
seemed threatened. This was a remarkable turnaround for the Soviet
people and for the world, and it all happened within less than a decade.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-580}Overall, the people's revolutions in
eastern Europe were astonishingly peaceful and nonviolent. The one big
exception was Yugoslavia, where nationalist demagogues in their hurry to
kill off the federal state set off waves of violence that were to last a
decade, inflicting terrible suffering on most Yugoslavs. Yugoslavia was
the prime example of a country that the Cold War had helped hold
together. Confronted with Soviet power in eastern Europe, as they had
been since 1948, most Yugoslavs had preferred sticking together in their
own, homegrown, federal state, even if they did not always like their
neighbors. But as the Cold War receded, some members of each Yugoslav
nationality began to worry about the consequences if one or more of the
other groups within that federal state got the upper hand on themselves.
Yugoslavia had been held together not by trust but by fear, and with the
object of that fear shifting, the country descended into destruction and
fratricide.</p>
<p><strong>O[THERS HAD MUCH]{.small-caps}</strong> to be grateful for. In America, the
year 1989 began on a cheerful note. Ronald Reagan was stepping down as
president after eight years in office, and was widely celebrated for his
achievements. The election of his vice president, George H. W. Bush, as
his successor confirmed that most Americans had forgiven Reagan for his
involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal as well as the increasingly
hands-off leadership style in his last years in office. What they
remembered, they thought, was a president who had fixed the economy and
removed the threat of nuclear destruction. No other president since
Woodrow Wilson had changed his foreign policy views more during his time
in office. In his farewell address, Reagan spoke about the Soviets as
partners. "My view," the departing president told the American people,</p>
<p>::: blockquote
is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders. I
think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying
to fix them. We wish him well. And we'll continue to work to make sure
that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a
less threatening one. What it all boils down to is this: I want the new
closeness to continue. And it will, as long as we make it clear that we
will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in
a helpful manner.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en585en">^1^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en585}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-581}President Bush was less certain. At the
beginning of his presidency, he wanted time to consider how US policy
toward the Soviets should develop under the new circumstances. A much
more traditional Cold Warrior than Reagan, Bush was not sure that the
"new closeness" would continue. On the contrary, as he noted at the
beginning of his presidency, the Soviet Union "presents a new and
complicated political challenge to us in Europe and elsewhere. My own
sense is that the Soviet challenge may be even greater than before
because it is more
varied."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en586en">^2^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en586} "The
Cold War is not over," warned Bush's national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft. There may be "light at the end of the tunnel. But I think it
depends partly on how we behave, whether the light is the sun or an
incoming
locomotive."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en587en">^3^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en587} Bush
and Scowcroft feared that perestroika and glasnost might be <em>too</em>
successful, so that the Western alliances lowered their guard too much.</p>
<p>Gorbachev was disappointed at Bush's "strategic pause." Why, he asked
himself, were the Americans hesitating now when he needed them most? In
western Europe Gorbachev was still regarded as a hero, and got a hero's
welcome everywhere. Even British prime minister Margaret Thatcher went
out of her way to heap praise on Gorbachev during their meetings in
London in April 1989. When Gorbachev complained about Bush, Thatcher
responded that "your success is in our interest. It is in our interest
that the Soviet Union become more peaceful, more affluent, more open to
change so that this would go together with personal freedoms, with more
openness, and exchanges. Continue your course, and we will support your
line. The prize will be
enormous."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en588en">^4^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en588}
Gorbachev's chief foreign policy aide, Anatolii Cherniaev, confided to
his diary that "Russia has no other option left. It has to become like
everybody else. If this happens, then the October and Stalin syndromes
will disappear from world politics. The world will truly be completely
different."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en589en">^5^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en589}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-582}But Gorbachev needed foreign support to
turn around his flagging fortunes at home. The CPSU still held a
predominant position in the Congress of People's Deputies. Gorbachev
wanted to move ahead with creating a more democratic Soviet Union as
soon as possible, including in the republics. He also wanted to reform
the economy, making some room for private enterprise. But while loans
and investments from abroad were very slow in arriving, the domestic
economy eroded further. High inflation and an increasing dependence on
the black market hindered the development of consumerism at home.
Government deficits increased, especially at the federal level, since
taxes were withheld or embezzled. And meanwhile resistance against
Gorbachev's leadership grew, both from leaders in the republics, who
wanted more power for themselves, and from within the Communist Party at
the central level, where traditionalists accused him of throwing away
the achievements of Soviet rule.</p>
<p>Nationalist unrest in a few of the Soviet republics also began to
undermine Gorbachev's position. In the Baltic states, forced to join the
USSR after World War II, most of the protest was peaceful, but
determined. Already in 1988 the Communist-controlled Supreme Soviet of
Estonia had declared that the laws of their republic took precedence
over Soviet laws. During the elections to the new federal assembly, more
than 80 percent of the seats in neighboring Lithuania went to
non-Communist candidates. In a further sign that even inside the Soviet
Union nationalism trumped ideology, the two Communist-led republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan began confronting each other over control of the
Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh inside Azerbaijan. Tens
of thousands of people fled from their homes and hundreds were killed,
including some by the Red Army, whom Gorbachev sent in to enforce the
peace. The crackdown bought some time for Moscow, but at the cost of
both sides accusing Gorbachev of siding with their
enemies.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en590en">^6^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en590}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-583}While Gorbachev attempted to march on with
his reforms in the Soviet Union, his Communist colleagues in eastern
Europe had less and less room for maneuver. Their economies were in
trouble, with high debt payments and stagnant production. By 1987 there
was nearly no growth at all, across the East Bloc, from Poland to
Bulgaria. Although living standards varied greatly, with East Germans,
Czechoslovaks, and Hungarians still doing better than, say, the poorer
countries in the European Community, the overall trend was downward.
Further loans from the West were hard to obtain, and the Soviets had
made it clear that they would look after their own urgent needs first.
In the late 1980s the economic situation started to spill over into
politics. Some Communist leaders, often of the younger generation,
started to feel that they needed to mobilize the whole people if an
economic collapse were to be avoided. And the only way such a
mobilization could happen was through political inclusiveness.</p>
<p>As always, it was Poland that went first. The leaders of the Polish
Communist Party found themselves in a desperate economic situation, in
which they were unable to repay their foreign loans while paying ever
more in wages and social services to prevent workers from rebelling
against them. In November 1987, encouraged by Moscow, they set up a
referendum in which they asked the population to vote yes to two
questions: Are you in favor of radical economic reform? Are you for a
deep democratization of political life? But Poles distrusted their
government so much that they would not even answer such questions in the
affirmative. In desperation, Poland's president, General Jaruzelski,
appointed a new government that would introduce market-based reforms in
the economy. But Polish workers welcomed the government with a wave of
strikes in 1988. It was clear that even the policy of buying off the
working class was failing.</p>
<p>Jaruzelski's final gamble was to arrange negotiations with the
opposition so that at least some groups could be persuaded to help take
responsibility for the economic crisis. He believed that although the
workers were still rebellious, the old leadership of Solidarity---most
of whom had been in prison since 1981---would no longer be the key
leaders. The government even allowed a televised debate in November 1988
between the head of their official trade union and Lech Wałęsa, the
former head of Solidarity. The result was another disaster. Wałęsa
trounced his opponent.</p>

<p>Forced by public opinion, encouraged by the Soviets, and entreated by
their own senior leaders, the Polish Communist Party's Central Committee
agreed to formal negotiations with the opposition to begin in February
1989. With Solidarity still banned, the movement appointed prominent
Polish intellectuals and Catholic clergy to represent them. Walesa
co-chaired the roundtable meetings with General Czesław Kiszczak, the
Communist minister of interior who had put him in prison in 1981. The
negotiations moved slowly at first. The Communists attempted to keep
constitutional reform from being discussed. Solidarity was split between
the Wałęsa mainstream and more radical factions that denounced any
compromise with the authorities. But slowly a compromise was reached, in
which Solidarity would be legalized and free elections held, to begin
with, for 35 percent of the seats in the lower house of parliament (the
Sejm) and for all of the seats in the new Senate. It was a risky
enterprise, both for the Communists and for Solidarity. Jaruzelski hoped
to legitimize the Communists' hold on power. Wałęsa wanted to show
Solidarity's strength in elections, set for 4 June 1989.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-585}While Communists and their opponents
battled for power in Poland, the Hungarian Communist Party was slowly
feeling its way toward a compromise with its own population. Hungary had
long been the most liberal of the East Bloc countries. But even there
the limit had been set at questioning the Communist Party's monopoly on
power. However, by 1988 younger leaders in the Hungarian party, inspired
by Gorbachev, wanted to go further in terms of liberalization. They
thought that by transforming the party, they stood a good chance of
hanging on to power, even if the opposition was allowed to organize. In
May 1988 the aging leader János Kádár, who had been in charge since the
Soviet invasion more than thirty years earlier, was replaced by the
reformer Károly Grósz. The new head of the party praised Gorbachev's
reforms. By February 1989 Hungary had introduced freedom of speech and
legalized some non-Communist groups. In May travel restrictions to
Austria were lifted, meaning that Hungarians were the first people in
the Warsaw Pact who could move freely across the borders to a
non-Communist country.</p>
<p>In June 1989 the Hungarian Communist authorities took a step that
dramatically indicated their break with the past. In Budapest, under
great official fanfare, the leader of the 1956 revolution, Imre Nagy,
was reburied. Nagy, who had been executed after the Soviet invasion,
stood for many as the symbol of Hungarian nationalism and resistance
against Moscow's domination. Gorbachev had only gradually come around to
reevaluating the events of 1956, but he let the Hungarians know that the
Soviets had no objections. Already in February 1989 he had made it clear
that the USSR was seeking "a restructuring of its relations with the
socialist countries" that emphasized "unconditional independence, full
equality, strict non-interference in internal affairs, and rectification
of deformities and mistakes linked with earlier periods in the history
of socialism."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en592en">^8^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en592}
Young Hungarians were out to test these intentions. Viktor Orbán, a
twenty-five-year-old who spoke on behalf of the youth at Nagy's funeral,
accused the Communists of having robbed young people of their future
through their "blind obedience to the Russian empire and [to] the
dictatorship of a single
party."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en593en">^9^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en593}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-586}As late as the summer of 1989 Gorbachev
remained convinced that his aim of a qualitatively new alliance among
socialist states could be made a reality. He wanted a reconstituted
socialist community, in which not only eastern Europe (including
Yugoslavia) but also China could find a place. Although Sino-Soviet
relations had improved during Gorbachev's time in power, he was, as
usual, impatient, and wanted more of a breakthrough than his assistants
had been able to give him with the skeptical Chinese. In 1989 he decided
to go to China himself in order to normalize relations and get off to a
new start through meeting with Deng Xiaoping. "One has to understand the
Chinese," Gorbachev told the Politburo. "They have a right to become a
great power." The Chinese were "getting stronger," the Soviet leader
said. "Everyone can see
it."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en594en">^10^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en594}</p>
<p>Gorbachev was undoubtedly right that China was getting stronger as a
result of Deng's economic reforms. But many of the most basic problems
in Chinese society remained similar to those the Soviets were trying to
deal with at home. After all, the People's Republic of China had been
set up as almost a direct copy of the USSR. By the late 1980s many young
Chinese were impatient for political and social reforms of the kind
Gorbachev was attempting to carry out in the Soviet Union. They demanded
freedom of speech and association, and deplored the corruption and
inequality that had come with the new direction in the economy. Deng
would have nothing of it. To him, reform meant strengthening, not
weakening, the Communist Party's grip on power. In 1986 he had
unceremoniously fired the party's general secretary, the popular Hu
Yaobang, for having moved too far in allowing an open debate of China's
problems. Students who protested were thrown in prison and workers who
attempted to organize independently of the party were harassed.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-587}When Hu Yaobang died suddenly in April
1989, student activists made his passing an occasion for lamenting the
lack of democracy in China. But the small memorial gatherings they
organized quickly turned into a broader protest against one-party
dictatorship. By May large rallies staged by students, workers, and
young professionals were taking place in the major cities, and
protesters occupied the central square in Beijing, at Tian'anmen. Their
slogans would not have been out of place in eastern Europe: Long live
democracy! Patriotism is not criminal! Oppose corruption! We are the
people! The Communist Party leadership hesitated on what to do. Deng
wanted an immediate crackdown, but the new secretary general, Deng's
protégé Zhao Ziyang, hoped to find a way of compromising with the
protesters. Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in Beijing on the first
visit of a Soviet leader for more than thirty years.</p>
<p>Instead of being a stunning international triumph, the May 1989 visit
turned into a quandary for the guests. With Tian'anmen off limits, the
Soviet delegation had to be smuggled into the Great Hall of the People
through a back entrance. From there, Gorbachev could hear the protesting
students chanting his name. He sympathized with the protesters, but
could not run the risk of criticizing his hosts. Instead he took refuge
in platitudes, talking about the friendship between the Soviet and
Chinese peoples. In private he wondered how long the Chinese Communists
would remain in power. "Some of those present here," he told his
colleagues in a meeting at the Soviet embassy on 15 May, "have promoted
the idea of taking the Chinese road. We saw today where this road leads.
I do not want Red Square to look like Tian'anmen
Square."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en595en">^11^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en595} Luckily
for Gorbachev, his host was intent on compromise. The questions of the
past, Deng said, somewhat lamely, were not "ideological disagreements.
We were also wrong.... The Soviet Union incorrectly perceived China's
place in the world.... The essence of all problems was that we were
unequal, that we were subjected to coercion and
pressure."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en596en">^12^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en596}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-588}With Gorbachev hurrying back to Moscow,
Deng Xiaoping had cleared the deck for his assault. For his hesitation,
the party leader Zhao Ziyang was dispatched in the same way as his
predecessor: he was to spend the next fifteen years under house arrest.
Drawing on his military connections, Deng made all the decisions. On 4
June tanks moved in to clear Tian'anmen Square. Hundreds of prodemocracy
protesters were killed as troops occupied central Beijing. Thousands
were imprisoned or went into exile. The new party leadership was
handpicked by Deng and his associates. China's international status
dropped considerably, but the country was too important to isolate
entirely, especially for the Bush Administration, which still believed
that it needed China to balance the USSR. Most importantly for the
Americans, Deng may have crushed the democratic aspirations of his
countrymen, but he was not about to give up on economic market reform. A
couple of years later, at the age of eighty-eight, he went on a tour of
the southern provinces and extolled their reformist zeal. "Are such
things as securities and stocks good, do they cause danger, are they
things unique to capitalism, can socialism make use of them?" he mused.
"It is permissible to judge, but we must be resolute in having a
try."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en597en">^13^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en597}</p>
<p>In eastern Europe, however, economic reform was no longer enough to
preserve Communist rule. Poland's first multiparty elections since the
start of the Cold War were held on the same day as the crackdown in
Beijing. The result was a disaster for the Communists, far beyond
anything they or Moscow had imagined. Of all the 161 contested seats in
the Sejm, Solidarity took 160. In the Senate, where all the seats were
contested, they won 99 out of 100. The final seat went to an independent
candidate. The Polish Communist Party, in power since 1945, was not just
defeated but humiliated. It tried to put together a new government from
its nominal majority in the Sejm, but allies and even party members
began to desert the sinking ship. On 24 August 1989 the Communists
capitulated, and the Sejm voted in a non-Communist government, headed by
the Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Everyone held their breath
to see what the Soviet reaction would be to the Communists' loss of
power.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-589}But Gorbachev's position was already
clear. In a speech to the Council of Europe after the Polish elections
the Soviet leader reminded his astonished listeners that "the social and
political orders of certain countries [in Europe] changed in the past,
and may change again in the future. However, this is exclusively a
matter for the peoples themselves to decide; it is their choice. Any
interference in internal affairs, or any attempts to limit the
sovereignty of states---including friends and allies, or anyone
else---is
impermissible."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en598en">^14^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en598}
His press spokesman, Gennadi Gerasimov, was even clearer: "We will
maintain ties with any Polish government that emerges after the recent
elections. This is purely a Polish internal affair. Any solution adopted
by our Polish friends will be acceptable to
us."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en599en">^15^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en599} Gorbachev's
chief foreign policy adviser, Anatolii Cherniaev, noted in his diary
that he thought "a complete dismantling of socialism as a factor of
world development is in process. Maybe this is inevitable and good. For
this is a matter of humanity uniting on the basis of common sense. And
this process was started by a regular guy from
Stavropol."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en600en">^16^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en600}</p>
<p>Both in western Europe and in the United States the reaction to events
in Poland was one of disbelief. Nobody had expected that the Polish
Communists would capitulate so fully or that Gorbachev would be the
midwife for a non-Communist Poland. The Bush Administration's approach
was, as usual, cautious. The president worried more about possible
unrest that could lead to a backlash from the Red Army in Poland or
against Gorbachev in the USSR than he did about assistance to the new
Polish government, which western Europeans were pressing hard for.
During his visit to Poland and Hungary in July 1989 Bush kept stressing
the need for moderate and realistic aims, and underlined that what the
United States could do to help was limited, not least financially. To
some Europeans, east and west, it was all too much caution. "Bush, as a
President, has a very big drawback," Mitterrand confided to Gorbachev,
"he lacks original thinking
altogether."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en601en">^17^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en601}</p>
<p>But on some issues the western Europeans were cautious themselves. This
was especially true for any issue that touched on the status of Germany.
The settlement of borders in Europe as a result of World War II,
including the borders that divided Germany, had kept the peace, some
leaders believed. It had also been helpful to the sense of western
Europe as a community of equals that West Germany had a not dissimilar
population size to France, Britain, and Italy, even if it had a larger
economy. As unrest began increasing in East Germany in early September
1989, both western and eastern European leaders, including Thatcher and
Mitterrand, underlined to Gorbachev that German unification was not on
the cards. Gorbachev agreed, but his main problem was the stability of
East Germany. Its leader, Erich Honecker, had stubbornly refused to go
along with any of the Soviet leader's tempered suggestions that reforms
were needed. By the late summer of 1989 Gorbachev was losing patience
with Honecker and his constant sniping at Gorbachev's own policies. The
GDR had even started banning Soviet publications from entering the
country. Gorbachev wanted Honecker replaced, but he could not express
this wish openly for fear of destabilizing the entire East German state.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-590}As it turned out, the citizens of East
Germany were even more impatient with their leader. Throughout the
summer of 1989 groups of East Germans had traveled to other eastern
European countries in order to get to West Germany from there. On 19
August the Hungarian authorities, acting in part from humanitarian
motives and in part in order to get West German loans, allowed 900 of
these refugees to cross the border to Austria. Honecker was furious and
accused the Hungarians of being traitors to socialism. But there was
little he could do about it. Inside East Germany open defiance of the
regime had begun to spread. In Leipzig, where the churches had organized
groups around human rights and disarmament, demonstrations began in
early September. First the slogan was "We Want to Leave." But then,
almost unperceptively, it shifted to "Down with Stasi," "We Are Going
Nowhere," and, unyieldingly and climactically, "We Are the People."
Thousands were arrested and some were beaten up. But the protests
continued.</p>
<p>The East German regime had nowhere to turn. Gorbachev despised most of
the leaders there. The West, including West Germany, would not come to
their rescue, even though Chancellor Helmut Kohl feared that Honecker
could use massive force to stay in power. For a while a "Chinese
solution" was indeed contemplated in East Berlin, but it was stranded on
Gorbachev's known position and on increasing worries among younger
Communist leaders that they could personally be held responsible for any
bloodshed. Honecker still believed he could ride out the storm. But the
upcoming fortieth anniversary of the GDR, which he had planned to
celebrate with all pomp possible, put him in a difficult spot. It gave
the opposition an aim for their mobilization. And, worse, it would bring
Gorbachev to Berlin as the guest of honor, in the middle of Honecker's
attempts at crushing the dissent.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-591}As usual, Gorbachev avoided criticizing
his hosts openly. The furthest he would go was in telling a TV reporter
on 6 October that the "only danger is not to react to life itself." But
it was clear to all who attended the closed-session meetings that
Honecker did not have the Soviet leader's trust. After Gorbachev's visit
the GDR police and military gave up trying to stop the demonstrators. At
least 70,000 marched in Leipzig 9 October. A week later the number was
120,000. And a week after that more than 300,000. By then Honecker was
gone, voted out by the Central Committee of his own party. The new party
chief, Egon Krenz, promised negotiations with the opposition. He also
made it clear that the East German authorities were preparing new and
more liberal travel arrangements for its citizens to visit West Germany,
including West Berlin. At a 9 November press conference, Günter
Schabowski, the GDR government's chief spokesman, said it had already
been decided that people with proper permission would be allowed to
cross the border. Asked repeatedly when the new regulations would come
into force, Schabowski finally said that he thought it would be
"immediately, forthwith."</p>
<p>That evening thousands of jubilant East Berliners moved toward the
checkpoints in the Wall, disregarding the need to apply for permission.
At first, GDR border guards, having no instructions on how to handle the
situation, tried to fend them off, threatening to shoot if the crowds
surged forward. They then began letting the loudest protestors pass
through individually and very slowly, in the hopes that doing so would
reduce tension. But the crowds just grew and were pushing up against the
Forbidden Zone around the checkpoints. Around 11:00 p.m., fearing for
their own safety, the East German officers gave up and lifted the
barriers.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en602en">^18^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en602} Large
groups of people began crossing from east to west without any documents
whatsoever. That evening they embraced their surprised western
countrymen along the main avenues in West Berlin. "What I will never
forget is this," one East Berliner remembers. "The taste of my first
strawberry yoghurt! It tasted so good that I lived on it for a
week!"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en603en">^19^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en603} Already
the next morning some enterprising Berliners began hacking away at the
Wall itself. East German guards tried to chase them away for another few
days. But by the end of the following week the guards themselves were
seen dismantling parts of the Wall. One of the most shameful symbols of
the Cold War was nearing its end.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-592}The accidental opening of the Berlin Wall
was, literally, the main breakthrough in the miraculous year 1989. With
the Wall down, relations between East and West Germany were certain to
be transformed. How far and how fast nobody could tell, but there was no
way things could stay the way they had been before. People and
policy-makers on both sides of the Iron Curtain began to imagine very
different kinds of futures. Almost everyone celebrated the
opportunities, but there were also concerns. For all its drawbacks and
human costs, the Cold War international system had kept the peace in
Europe for almost fifty years. People born in 1900 had seen two
cataclysmic wars, in which more than sixty million Europeans died.
People born fifty years later had seen none.</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War in Europe first and foremost meant an
opportunity to end the German problem. The Cold War had kept Germany
divided, against the wishes of most of its population. The opening of
the Berlin Wall foretold some ending of that abnormal situation. But
European leaders were wary of Germany's size and its economic power,
especially if unified. For the leaders in the European Community, except
Thatcher, who was profoundly skeptical of Germany reuniting at all, the
solution had to be further European integration. Within a deeper form of
community, which would make nation-states parts of a European political,
economic, and monetary union, Germany's strengths would be Europe's
strength. Helmut Kohl agreed. In a speech to the Bundestag in November
1989, where he launched a ten-point plan for German unity, Kohl stressed
Germany's essential European-ness: "The future architecture of Germany
must fit into the future architecture of Europe.... Linking the German
question to the development of Europe as a whole... makes possible an
organic development that takes into account the interests of everyone
involved"<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en604en">^20^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en604}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-593}The Single European Act, which had come
into force in the European Community in 1987, was the most ambitious
expansion of the integration process for thirty years. The agreement
committed the members to move toward a full European Union, with all
tariffs and border controls removed, and with free movement of goods,
people, services, and capital. The Union would also aim for a common
monetary policy and help coordinate common foreign and defense policies.
It was a big step, which helped reduce concern with an overmighty
Germany sitting astride Europe and pointed toward the Maastricht
agreement of 1992. "Economic and monetary union will be a linchpin in
favor of political integration," insisted France's president, François
Mitterrand. "It will mean that a decisive step will have been taken
toward achieving a real union---that is, a European political
union."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en605en">^21^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en605}</p>
<p>The French president was probably among the first European leaders who
realized that some form of German unification would be impossible to
avoid. But he wanted to get the maximum in return, for himself and for
France, in order to agree to such a rearrangement. He therefore played
on Thatcher's doubt about German reunification in order, later, to act
as mediator on behalf of the Germans. This scheme, Mitterrand thought,
would connect a unified Germany even more closely to France and help
deliver French aims, such as monetary union and stronger political
integration. "The sudden prospect of reunification had delivered a sort
of mental shock to the Germans. Its effect had been to turn them once
again into the 'bad' Germans they used to be," the French president told
Thatcher in January 1990. "He had said to [Kohl] that no doubt Germany
could if it wished achieve reunification, bring Austria into the
European Community and even regain other territories which it had lost
as a result of the war. They might make even more ground than had
Hitler. But they would have to bear in mind the
implications."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en606en">^22^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en606}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-594}The devious Mitterrand had of course said
no such thing. In public, as in private to the West German leaders, he
had from the very beginning stressed Germany's right to
self-determination.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en607en">^23^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en607}
What really limited the significance of the French president's scheming,
however, was George Bush's surprisingly clear and immediate support of
Kohl's policies. Already in November 1989 Bush had told the German
leader that he was "very supportive of your general approach.... We are
on the same wavelength. I appreciated your ten points and your
exposition on the future of
Germany."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en608en">^24^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en608} More
importantly, Bush told both the US public and members of his own
Administration not to fear German unification. And already by February
1990 he instructed his secretary of state, James Baker, that the US aim
was "a unified Germany in the Western
alliance."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en609en">^25^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en609} The
US president's position left Thatcher fuming on the sidelines and Kohl
free to develop his policy for unification. The big question was how
Mikhail Gorbachev would react to the German plans.</p>
<p>While East Germany was collapsing, the onslaught against the other
eastern European Communist regimes continued. The Hungarian regime,
which had been one of the forerunners for reform, avoided further
protest by simply dissolving the Communist Party and the People's
Republic already in October 1989. The party was reborn as the Socialist
Party, within a reconstituted Republic of Hungary. The new government
set May 1990 as the month for Hungary's first free elections for over
forty years. The reaction in the Kremlin, so different from 1956, was
simply to congratulate the Hungarian party with its courage and
foresight. Soviet foreign minister Shevardnadze declared that "each
country has the right to absolute freedom of
choice."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en610en">^26^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en610}</p>
<p>In Czechoslovakia, where the regime had resisted reform for as long as
it could, the end was different but synchronous. Being burdened with the
responsibility for the crackdown after the Soviet invasion in 1968, the
Communist Party was even more unpopular in Czechoslovakia than elsewhere
in eastern Europe. The man who had been in charge of the persecution,
Gustáv Husák, had been forced to resign as party leader in 1987, in part
because he was personally anathema to Gorbachev. But the leaders who
replaced him were entirely hapless, especially Miloš Jakeš, the new
general secretary, whose bumbling speeches were the cause of much mirth
across the country. A week after the Berlin Wall had come down,
demonstrations against the government broke out in Prague. They soon
spread to others parts of the country. Prominent intellectuals, among
them the playwright Václav Havel, who had several times been imprisoned
for dissent, formed a Civic Forum, which demanded talks with the regime.
Journalists took over some of the newspapers and began spreading the
message of the opposition, including calling for a general strike. Jakeš
and some members of the party leadership wanted to use the police and
military against the demonstrators, but found that they could not be
trusted. On 24 November Jakeš and the entire party presidium resigned,
and the new leaders began negotiating with the opposition.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-595}The next day it became clear that the
balance of power in Czechoslovakia had changed forever. In Prague alone,
eight hundred thousand people marched against the Communist Party,
chanting slogans such as "We Want Democracy," "Back to Europe," and
"Havel for President." Alexander Dubček, the party leader who had been
forced out by the Soviets after 1968, joined with the demonstrators. In
speeches both in his native Slovakia and in Prague, Dubček called for
change and nonviolence. "If there once was light, why should there be
darkness again?" Dubček told the crowds. "Let us act... to bring back
the light."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en611en">^27^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en611} On
29 November the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, still dominated by
Communists, voted to introduce multiparty democracy. A month later the
same assembly voted in the former dissident Václav Havel as new
president of the country. A whole generation of Communist officials
slunk away into the shadows. In his first speech as president, Havel
gave his harsh verdict on what Czechoslovakia's "velvet revolution" had
inherited: "Our country is not flourishing. The enormous creative and
spiritual potential of our nations is not being used sensibly. Entire
branches of industry are producing goods that are of no interest to
anyone, while we are lacking the things we need. A state which calls
itself a workers' state humiliates and exploits workers. Our obsolete
economy is wasting the little energy we have available.... We have
polluted the soil, rivers and forests bequeathed to us by our ancestors,
and we have today the most contaminated environment in Europe." The only
solution, Havel said, was to create "a republic of well-rounded people,
because without such people it is impossible to solve any of our
problems---human, economic, ecological, social, or
political."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en612en">^28^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en612}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-596}In Bulgaria the end of Communism came in a
different way, and more slowly. The poorest of the East Bloc countries,
Bulgaria had benefitted more than any of the others from exchanges among
them. Even in the 1980s, many Bulgarians saw Communism as a relatively
successful development program, even though they resented the
authoritarianism and oppression of the government. Most Bulgarians also
felt a distinct kinship with the Russians for cultural and historical
reasons. With Gorbachev in power in Moscow, this sense of closeness
could lead to unexpected results, though. On 10 November, one day after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, younger Communist leaders ousted party head
Todor Zhivkov for his failure to instigate Gorbachev-style reforms.
Zhivkov had lead the party for more than thirty-five years. He was a
father figure for many Bulgarians and not widely hated like a Husak or a
Jaruzelski. The new leaders wanted to build on the successes of
Bulgarian socialism, while moving closer to the European Community, and
position themselves to remain in power after a multiparty system had
been introduced.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Communists succeeded to a remarkable degree with their
plans, though they did so by nefarious means. By initiating roundtable
negotiations along the Polish model, they bought time so that the party
could reconstitute itself as a Socialist Party in time for the first
free elections in June 1990. Uniquely in the former Soviet bloc, the
former Bulgarian Communists not only won the first free election but
helped oversee the transition to a new market-based economic system. But
a main reason for their success was an unprecedented Communist campaign
to force Muslim Bulgarians to give up their identity and take Christian
names. Starting in 1984, Zhivkov's regime had prohibited the use of
Turkish in public and closed many mosques. In 1989, as it came under
pressure, the Communist Party began forcibly deporting Muslim activists
to Turkey. Several people were killed in clashes with the police. In the
panic that followed at least three hundred thousand Bulgarian Muslims
were expelled or fled across the border. It linked the Communist Party
with Bulgarian nationalism and foreshadowed the terrible crimes that
would happen further west in the Balkans a few years later.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-597}Even worse violence took place in Romania,
as the Communist Party there tried to cling on to power. The Romanian
leader Nicolae Ceauşescu prided himself on his country's independence
from Moscow. Although nominally a member of the Warsaw Pact, Romania had
condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and later criticized
Soviet involvement in the Horn of Africa and in the Middle East.
Romanian insubordination was of course welcomed in the West, and
Ceauşescu was rewarded with access to Western technology and invitations
to foreign capitals. In 1978 the increasingly erratic dictator was even
granted a visit with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace---having been
tipped off in advance, the palace staff reportedly removed all valuables
from the guest rooms so that Ceauşescu and his wife Elena would not
bring them back to their poverty-stricken country. For while Ceauşescu
was being feted abroad, Romania was falling deeper and deeper into
destitution, not least because their leader insisted on spending
enormous amounts on gigantic vanity projects, such as the construction
of the world's largest parliament building in the capital, Bucharest.</p>
<p>Ceauşescu believed he was safe from the sort of upheavals that happened
elsewhere in eastern Europe in the fall of 1989, since his regime was
not dependent on Soviet support. But Romanians were running out of
patience. Living standards had declined for more than a decade and
shortages were acute. Besides Albania, Romania's GDP was the lowest in
Europe, roughly on a par with Jordan or Jamaica. And Ceauşescu's
insistence on being treated like a godlike figure even by other
Communist Party leaders made some of them long to get rid of him. The
end therefore came quickly when it came. After a week's unrest in the
city of Timişoara, Ceauşescu addressed the people of Bucharest in front
of his new Parliament building. At first things looked normal. Hundreds
of people were holding up posters with Ceauşescu's portrait, as they
always had done at such events. The party leader saluted the
revolutionary courage of the capital's population. Then:</p>

:::</p>
<p>All of this was in front of live microphones and therefore broadcast to
the whole country.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out around the square and engulfed the city overnight.
Nobody could quite say who was fighting whom because some military units
joined the protesters. Hundreds of people were killed. There were rumors
of snipers from Ceauşescu's dreaded secret police, the Securitate,
firing on people from rooftops. The next morning the crowds stormed the
Central Committee building, where the Ceauşescus had been hiding out.
But they had already fled by helicopter. On landing in a small town 75
kilometers northwest of Bucharest, the president and his wife were taken
prisoner by the local military. On Christmas Day 1989 they were both
shot after a summary trial. The film of their trial is a sad sight: an
elderly, bewildered couple who do not quite understand what is happening
to them. As the verdict is read, they ask to be executed together.
Communist Romania ended, as it had begun, in blood.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-599}While eastern Europe liberated itself, the
Soviet and the US leaders finally met for a proper summit, on ships
anchored at Malta in the Mediterranean in December 1989. At their first
meeting, onboard the Soviet ship <em>Maksim Gorkii</em>, Bush and Gorbachev
agreed that the Cold War was over. But they drew different conclusions
as to what that meant. For Bush, it seemed as if removing the USSR as a
consistent adversary simply freed the United States to get more of what
it wanted elsewhere. To Gorbachev's amazement, in view of the historic
changes in Europe, one of Bush's main points was to end Soviet support
for Nicaragua (and hopefully also for Cuba). It seemed as if to the US
president the Cold War had simply returned to where it had been before
World War II---a global ideological struggle, rather than a conflict
between two Superpowers. For the Soviet president, the stakes were much
higher. This was principally because he faced a battle for reform inside
the USSR. But it was also because he believed that the world was turning
away from what had produced the Cold War. "We see today that reliance on
force, on military superiority, was wrong," Gorbachev told Bush.</p>
<p>::: blockquote
It did not justify itself.... The emphasis on confrontation based on our
different ideologies is wrong. We had reached a dangerous point, and it
is good that we stopped to reach an understanding. Reliance on nonequal
exchange between the developed countries and the developing world cannot
go on. It has collapsed. Look at how many problems there are in the
developing world that affect all of us. Overall, my conclusion is that
strategically and philosophically, the methods of the Cold War were
defeated... [though] we face problems of survival, including the
environment and problems of
resources.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en614en">^30^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en614}
:::</p>
<p>At Malta, the two sides agreed to intensify arms control negotiations,
consult on German questions, and open up for increased trade and
technological exchanges. The summit went off well. But it was also clear
that the two men had less to talk about than at earlier Soviet-American
summits. The Cold War international system was fading fast. Gorbachev
was facing the battle of his life in reforming and uniting the Soviet
Union, while transitioning it to a democratic form of government. There
is no doubt that Bush genuinely wished him well in that enterprise. Bush
believed that the United States had won the inter-state Cold War, and
his inherent caution made him disinclined to believe that high levels of
conflict inside the USSR at this stage would necessarily be to the US
advantage. Some of his advisers thought that only the breakup of the
Soviet Union would mean a final end to the Cold War. But the president
was not on their side. Bush, as always, preferred stability over any
kind of risk-taking.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-600}When Gorbachev returned to Moscow,
problems were piling up. In the Caucasus, the Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan was blockading the Soviet republic of Armenia, creating
massive economic dislocation. In the Baltic states, the demand for
independence was getting increasingly vocal. In August 1989 people
across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined hands, quite literally, and
formed the longest human chain ever. They sang songs of freedom and
independence, and of telling the truth about history. "Three sisters
woke up from their sleep, now come to stand for themselves," went one of
them.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en615en">^31^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en615} In Moscow,
the CPSU Central Committee condemned what they called mindless
nationalism. But even the Communists in the Baltic states understood
which way the wind was blowing. In December 1989, just after Gorbachev
returned from the Malta summit, the Lithuanian Communist Party broke
with the CPSU and asserted its full independence. Like in eastern
Europe, the Baltic Communists had begun to believe that the only way
they could remain relevant was by joining the national revolution.</p>
<p>Given the high level of nationalist agitation that took place in some of
the European and Caucasian republics, many CPSU leaders advised
Gorbachev to postpone the free elections that he had promised they would
hold in 1990. But Gorbachev held firm. He feared that taking a step back
now would lead to him losing control over the CPSU at the central union
level. To his advisers, Gorbachev explained that only if he could play
the democrats against the party apparatus did he stand a chance of
success. It was clear that he did not fully trust his own party any
longer. In the Baltic republics the elections went as could be expected.
In all of them non-Communist parties won. These parties then proceeded
to do what they had promised their electorate: to assert national
independence. Lithuania went first and furthest. In March 1990 its
elected Supreme Soviet reconstituted itself as the Supreme Council,
which promptly declared that "the sovereign powers of the State of
Lithuania, abolished by foreign forces in 1940, is re-established, and
henceforth Lithuania is again an independent
state."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en616en">^32^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en616} Nobody
in the council voted against the declaration of independence. Two weeks
later the Estonian assembly proclaimed the Soviet occupation of their
country illegal, and the Latvians followed suit in May 1990. Gorbachev
had a very big challenge on his hands.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-601}Gorbachev's aim in 1990 was to force the
CPSU, the party of which he was still the general secretary, to give up
its monopoly on power. The Soviet leader was in many ways inspired by
the events in eastern Europe. He wanted democracy, but he also wanted a
strong Communist Party capable of winning elections and defending the
achievements of the socialist era. He wanted to devolve power to the
republics, but keep the USSR united as a state. On the economy, he
wanted foreign loans to help the country back on its feet, and the
introduction of gradual market reforms. Remarkably, Gorbachev seemed
politically deaf to just how much damage the economic deterioration did
to his ability to the lead the Soviet Union. He believed that political
reform and the new sense of freedom all over the USSR would make up for
the absence of consumer goods, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>On this the Soviet leader was almost certainly wrong. The more Soviet
citizens learned about how far behind other countries they were in terms
of what they could buy in their shops and markets, the more they blamed
Gorbachev and the CPSU leadership for it. Opinions polls, freely
conducted in the USSR for the first time, showed that a massive majority
of citizens believed that things were getting more difficult and that
the weakest were suffering the consequences. Outside of the cities, very
few people joined in the political ferment. "We didn't pay much
attention," said one villager from Volgoda. "Our kolkhoz director would
tell us that perestroika and glasnost were important, but why would we
believe him? We watched the rallies and speeches on television, but it
was nothing to do with our
lives."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en617en">^33^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en617}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-602}Meanwhile, in Moscow Gorbachev was facing
increasing challenges, even after the Congress of People's Deputies
elected him president of the USSR in March 1990. In the new assembly,
opinions were strongly divided between liberals, who believed that
Gorbachev was moving too slowly, and conservatives, who thought he was
moving too fast. Inside the Communist Party apparatus, many were
horrified at how easily Gorbachev had let eastern Europe go and feared
that he would also give up on keeping the Soviet Union together. In the
Russian Republic, one of the fifteen constituent republics of the USSR,
liberal reformers had the upper hand in the republic's assembly after
the elections in the spring of 1990, but, instead of supporting
Gorbachev, they elected Boris Yeltsin chairman. Yeltsin engineered a
Russian declaration of sovereignty, in which the biggest of the
republics, covering three quarters of Soviet territory, declared that
the laws of the Russian Republic took precedence over Soviet laws.
Yeltsin then in a dramatic speech resigned from the Communist Party of
the USSR. At the time, many thought that all of this was mainly
showmanship on the part of the flamboyant Yeltsin. But over the months
that followed, with other republics following Russia's example, the
issue of Soviet legitimacy became more and more complicated.</p>
<p>At first Gorbachev stood firm. He refused to accept independence for
Lithuania or claims of full sovereignty for republics elsewhere. In 1989
the Red Army had used force to break up nationalist demonstrations in
Georgia. Twenty people were killed. In January 1990, after months of
unrest and ethnic clashes between Azeris and Armenians, Soviet special
forces took control of the Azerbaijan capital of Baku against strong
Azeri nationalist opposition. The Soviet minister of defense, Dmitrii
Iazov, personally directed the operations. At least 130 civilians were
killed, along with 30 Red Army soldiers. The bloody crackdown did little
to stem Azerbaijan's drift toward asserting its national sovereignty.
But it did, at least temporarily, strengthen Gorbachev's hand against
party hard-liners in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-603}The image of Gorbachev as a hapless victim
of events after the Communist collapse in eastern Europe does not hold
up to scrutiny. Gorbachev had <em>wanted</em> the democratization of the
eastern European countries and the removal of the Iron Curtain. He also
wanted the democratization of the Soviet Union along lines similar to
what was happening further west. In the summer of 1990 he made his views
clear in a speech to the Twenty-eighth Congress of the Communist Party:</p>
<p>::: blockquote
In place of the Stalinist model of socialism we are coming to a
citizens' society of free people. The political system is being
transformed radically, genuine democracy with free elections, the
existence of many parties and human rights is becoming established and
real people's power is being revived.... The transformation of the
super-centralised state into a true union state founded on
self-determination and the voluntary unity of the peoples has begun. In
place of an atmosphere of ideological dictatorship we have come to
freedom of thought and glasnost and openness about information in
society.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en618en">^34^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en618}
:::</p>
<p>But Gorbachev did not just trust his ideals. As events in Georgia and
Azerbaijan showed, he still had the loyalty of the Red Army both when he
wanted to use force and when he did not want to use it. Subservience to
the country's political leadership was so deeply engrained in the Soviet
military that they did not question orders, nor did they assume
political responsibilities on their own. The same was true for the KGB.
But that organization was increasingly split. Some old-timers, such as
KGB chairman Vladimir Kriuchkov, put the preservation of the USSR above
all other duties. A younger generation of secret police officers
realized both that change was inevitable and that they had skills and
information that would serve them well as individuals whatever the
outcome of the political struggles at the top. By late 1990 a number of
them were in touch with managers of enterprises planning to privatize or
with foreigners hoping to invest in a new economy.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-604}Gorbachev's main problem was therefore not
disloyality in the "ministries of power" but the political contest going
on within the Soviet leadership. As CPSU general secretary he was
increasingly caught between two groups. His liberal advisers---Aleksandr
Iakovlev, Georgii Shakhnazarov, Anatolii Cherniaev, and others---wanted
him to ditch the Communist Party, call a snap union-wide presidential
election, and contest it as a democratic socialist. The top members of
his government, the Defense Ministry, and the KGB wanted him to
reinstall discipline in the Communist Party and crush the national
independence movements. Gorbachev was caught in the middle. He would not
give up on the CPSU because he believed it was still key to holding the
union together. If not the CPSU, what is there, he challenged his more
impatient acolytes. At the same time, he refused to give permission for
an all-out assault against the nationalists in the republics. He was
willing to authorize crackdowns, but only when ethnic violence or a
chance for real secession demanded it. Massive bloodshed was not on the
agenda.</p>
<p>In international affairs Gorbachev's main strategy from 1990 on was to
link the Soviet Union more closely to Europe. Like his liberal advisers,
he had always seen the Soviet future in Europe, and the liberation of
eastern Europe had made a closer connection with the main European
countries possible. Gorbachev spoke often, and well, about "a common
European home, from the Atlantic to the Urals," a Gaullist phrase that
was intended to appeal to European self-interest in assisting the Soviet
transformation. But the Soviet leader knew that the realization of such
a concept was inconceivable without a solution to the German problem.
Not only was West Germany the major economic power in Europe, but East
Germany still stood as a constant reminder of a failed Soviet European
policy, in which it had busied itself building walls across the
continent instead of tearing them down.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-605}By February 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev had
concluded that some form of German unification was inevitable, and that
the USSR would be best served by playing a positive role in the process.
What made the undertaking speed up beyond what most observers, including
most German observers, had imagined possible was the combined effect of
the breakdown in the East German economy and the elections there in
March 1990. With access to West German products they deemed superior,
few people in the east wanted to buy eastern goods anymore. Production
stalled. Still, the more expensive consumer items from the west were
unobtainable for East Germans because their money was near worthless
when exchanged for the deutschmark. In the election more than 40 percent
of East Germans voted for Kohl's CDU---a party that had nearly no base
in the east---simply because they thought doing so would speed up
unification. The result astonished Europe. With the same party now
ruling both East and West Germany, it was clear that unification was not
an issue for the future. It was an issue for the here and now.</p>
<p>With Britain's Margaret Thatcher indignant on the sidelines, all western
European leaders fell in step behind President Bush and West German
<em>Bundeskanzler</em> Helmut Kohl in starting an international process to
agree to the conditions for Germany's full reunification. The so-called
"Two-Plus-Four" negotiations (the two Germanies plus the victorious
Great Powers from World War II) began in May 1990, with the real
sticking points being whether a united Germany could be a member of NATO
and the pace and format of the actual unification procedures. To the
surprise of the Western powers (and to the dismay of the British and to
some extent the French), Gorbachev agreed not only to a united Germany
in NATO but also to the process being completed within the year. West
German promises of further economic assistance to the USSR helped pave
the way. But even more significant was Gorbachev's conviction that NATO
or Germany were no longer enemies of the Soviets. They were friends and
partners. In their meeting in July 1990 near Stavropol, where Gorbachev
was born, Kohl put it well: "One may not forget history. For without a
knowledge of history the present could not be understood nor the future
be shaped. Most of those present at this table roughly belonged to his
generation---they had still experienced the war as children, too young
to become guilty, but old enough to understand. It was the task of this
generation to settle some things at the end of this century before
passing the baton on to the next
generation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en619en">^35^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en619}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-606}Emotional as he was about unification and
a new German-Russian relationship, Kohl did not neglect creating facts
on the ground to make the unification process irreversible. In the
summer of 1990 the deutschmark was made the official currency of East
Germany and a full "monetary, economic, and social union" between the
two states came into being. West German laws were gradually introduced
in East Germany, and in August the East German parliament made a formal
request to the West German government to be incorporated into the
Federal Republic of Germany. Kohl knew such brisk moves would raise
criticism even among his Western allies. But he felt it was a risk worth
taking. There were still hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers
stationed in East Germany. If something happened to Gorbachev, Kohl
needed to be able to deal with whatever government replaced him in
Moscow.</p>
<p>Right up to the final negotiations in Moscow in September 1990 it was
unclear whether all of Germany would be NATO territory and whether
Germany would regain its full sovereignty immediately upon
reunification. The British, truculent to the finish, insisted on the
right of allied NATO troops to enter what would soon be the former East
Germany, knowing that the Soviets would turn this down. The veteran West
German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher would have nothing of
these tactics. Himself born in eastern Germany, Genscher wanted no delay
in reunification. He insisted on an immediate agreement and on full
German sovereignty. Working with the Soviets and the French, Genscher
pushed back on the British demands. In the end, the parties agreed to a
last-minute fudge: non-German troops would not be permanently stationed
or deployed in the east, but the definition of the term "deployed" would
be decided by the German government, "in a reasonable and responsible
way, taking into consideration the security interests" of each of the
powers.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en620en">^36^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en620} On 12
September 1990 the Two-Plus-Four Treaty was signed, opening for German
unification three weeks later. Even the seasoned diplomat Genscher was
moved at the signing: "This is a historic moment for the whole of Europe
and a happy one for the Germans. Together we have come a long way in a
short time.... On 3 October we Germans will again be living in one
democratic state, for the first time in 57 years.... [Now] we want
nothing more than to live in freedom, democracy and peace with all other
nations."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en621en">^37^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en621}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-607}But if German unification seemed almost a
miracle in its simplicity and smoothness, trouble was brewing elsewhere
in Europe. A bit like in the Soviet Union, the republics of the Yugoslav
federation had been drifting apart for several years. But even inside
the bigger republics there were ethnic tensions. In Albanian-majority
Kosovo, then a part of the Yugoslav Serbian republic, Albanian miners
went on strike in 1989 to demand more rights for their community. The
Kosovo miners were supported by non-Communist nationalist groups in the
Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia farther north. In Serbia, the
leader of the Communist Party there, Slobodan Milošević, saw the Kosovo
demands as yet another attempt at undermining Serbia's position within
Yugoslavia. In a 1989 speech he condemned those who wanted to split
Yugoslavia and claimed that the Serbs had sacrificed more than others to
keep the country free and united. The concessions "the Serbian leaders
made at the expense of their people could not be accepted historically
and ethically by any nation in the world, especially because the Serbs
have never in the whole of their history conquered and exploited
others."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en622en">^38^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en622}</p>
<p>But Milošević could not stem the centrifugal forces in Yugoslavia. On
the contrary, his own nationalist rhetoric contributed to them. In
January 1990 the Slovenian and Croatian Communist parties broke away
from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. In April free elections in both
republics led to non-Communist majorities. In Serbia, on the other hand,
Milošević and the now rump Communist Party solidified their hold on
power. The scene was set for a showdown. In December 1990 a referendum
in Slovenia delivered a 95 percent vote for independence. In Croatia
nationalists also won an independence referendum, but substantial
non-Croat minorities, among them the fifth of the population who were of
Serbian origin, boycotted the vote. When Slovenia and Croatia, with
encouragement from a newly reunited Germany, declared full independence
the following year, the scene was set for the Yugoslav wars, which
devastated the former federal republic over the next ten years. At least
140,000 people died and several million were displaced in the worst
warfare in Europe since World War II, wars that the new European
institutions altogether failed to stop.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-608}In Moscow Gorbachev was battling on to
avoid a similar fate for the Soviet Union. After the deal on Germany, he
hoped that West German credits and international political support would
help him stabilize the situation internally in the Soviet Union. But
until the economy stabilized, Gorbachev's plan was to hold the Communist
Party together through compromises with party traditionalists and with
moderate nationalists in the republics. The new CPSU Politburo, elected
at the Twenty-eighth Party Congress in the summer of 1990, was a mix of
the two groups, with very few of the general secretary's reformist
allies onboard. In December 1990, after Gorbachev picked the
conservative nonentity Gennadii Ianaev as his vice president, Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze resigned, publicly accusing Gorbachev of leading
the country back toward a dictatorship. In a rambling speech,
Shevardnadze claimed that "nobody knows what this dictatorship will be
like, what kind of dictator will come to power and what kind of order
will be
established."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en623en">^39^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en623}
Shevardnadze's resignation was a hard blow for Gorbachev. The two had
worked together to implement perestroika since Gorbachev's election in
1985. And, worse, the foreign minister was followed out the door in
early 1991 by many other reformers, who either resigned or were thrown
out by the new party leadership.</p>
<p>In the Russian Republic the increasingly populist Boris Yeltsin made
promises of improved services and a better economy if, and only if,
Russia took more power for itself within the union. Entirely free from
the pressures of compromise and incumbency that dogged Gorbachev,
Yeltsin could promise all things to all men, but he was also a shrewd
politician who knew that he needed to solidify his position within
Russia in preparation for whatever upheavals were to come within the
Soviet state. In neighboring Ukraine, the second-largest of the Slavic
republics in the USSR, the leader of its parliament Leonid Kravchuk had
similar thoughts. Still a member of the Communist Party, Kravchuk was
far less willing to attack the Soviet Union than Yeltsin was. But even
he had accepted Ukraine's declaration of full sovereignty in the summer
of 1990, a month after Russia. In November the two had signed a separate
pact of mutual support and friendship. And when Gorbachev again
attempted to use force in the Baltics in January 1991, the leaders of
Russia and Ukraine protested jointly. Yeltsin went to Tallinn, the
capital of Estonia, where in usual dramatic fashion he recognized the
independence of the Baltic republics and exhorted Russian Red Army
soldiers to disobey orders from the Kremlin. In Moscow more than one
hundred thousand people marched in support of independence for the
Balts.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-609}Besides using the Red Army, Gorbachev had
one final method by which he hoped to keep the union together. That was
to appeal directly to the people in a referendum. In March 1991, against
much resistance among his advisers, both liberal and conservative, he
went to the country with the following question: "Do you consider
necessary the preservation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as
a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights
and freedom of an individual of any nationality will be fully
guaranteed?" It was, to put it mildly, a leading question, and not
surprisingly the Balts, the Georgians, and the Armenians refused to
participate. But the results in the other republics were still a massive
popular vote for the union, with "yes" collecting more than
three-quarters of the votes. In Russia 73 percent voted in favor of the
union, which perhaps was not surprising given that Russia had
constituted the USSR in the first place. But votes in Ukraine (71
percent yes) and in Central Asia (between 95 and 98 percent yes) were
surprises, and gave Gorbachev hope as he worked over the summer on
revising the union treaty in line with the referendum question.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-610}The Cold War's central logic had been that
one of the Superpowers had to lose for the other to win. For many US
leaders this had in reality meant that there could be no lasting peace
in the Cold War until the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. But in 1991,
as the scenario of a Soviet collapse stopped being entirely implausible,
the cautious George H. W. Bush quickly moved away from believing that
the end of the USSR would in fact be in the US interest. Gorbachev's
Soviet Union was of course already a very different state from that of
Stalin. But the real issue was with new challenges arising, also for the
United States, as the Cold War receded. In January 1991 the Americans
had gone to war against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait. Even though he worked hard to avoid war through an Iraqi
withdrawal---Iraq was after all an old Soviet ally---Gorbachev sided
almost completely with the United States as soon as US operations in the
Gulf began. "Our doubts, yours and mine, about Saddam Hussein have
proven right," he told President Bush. "He is the kind of person against
whom force is necessary. I have a full understanding of this burden to
the nations of the
world."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en624en">^40^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en624}</p>
<p>After the US victory in the Gulf War, Bush's attention was even more
taken by the need for some degree of Soviet stability to help the United
States tackle international crises and prevent the spread of weapons of
mass destruction. Bush began to consider seriously what might happen to
Soviet nuclear arsenals if conflict spread inside the USSR. He therefore
cold-shouldered Yeltsin and some of the more extreme of Gorbachev's
opponents, even after Yeltsin had been elected president by the people
of the Russian Republic in June 1991. During a visit to the Ukrainian
capital, Kiev, at the beginning of August, Bush spoke to the Ukrainian
parliament, which the previous year had declared Ukraine a sovereign
republic. "We will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the
Soviet Government of President Gorbachev," Bush told the Ukrainians.
"Freedom is not the same as independence. Americans will not support
those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a
local despotism." Bush hoped that the Soviet "Republics will combine
greater autonomy with greater voluntary interaction---political, social,
cultural, economic---rather than pursuing the hopeless course of
isolation."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en625en">^41^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en625}
Nationalist Ukrainians were flabbergasted and angry, and in Washington
conservatives referred to Bush's address as the "Chicken Kiev speech."
But for the US president Soviet dissolution now seemed more dangerous
than Soviet power, with the potential for civil and interstate wars
breaking out on a vast scale across Eurasia. That these fears were not
realized is something we now take for granted, but it was not
necessarily the case that the Soviet bloc would on the whole avoid the
eventual fate of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-611}As Gorbachev prepared to put his signature
to the new union treaty, he had reason to be cautiously optimistic about
the future of his balancing act. Gorbachev thought that it would all
come down to the economy: with the union secured within a new framework,
gradual economic reform would proceed, helped by European, American, and
Asian investments. Gorbachev foresaw a future split in the Communist
Party, both at the union and the republic levels, with himself leading
an all-union socialist party that he hoped would compete successfully
within a democratic system. On 4 August 1991 the general secretary went
on vacation to the Crimea, as he had done every year since he came to
office. He expected to finish his work on the new union treaty while
there.</p>
<p>Two weeks later Moscow awoke to news that a nationwide state of
emergency had been declared. Gorbachev, said the news bulletins, had
gone on sick leave. In his place, a government committee, headed by Vice
President Ianaev, was in charge. Muscovites, and the whole country, had
little doubt that there had been a coup d'état. In Moscow, citizens took
to the streets, meeting in front of the Russian parliament building,
where Yeltsin and his advisers had barricaded themselves. Censorship was
reintroduced and leaders of the opposition arrested by the KGB.
Paratroopers took up positions at key intersections.</p>
<p>In reality Gorbachev was kept prisoner in his Crimean dacha. The day
before the coup was announced, a delegation, including his own chief of
staff, had been sent by the plotters to demand his acquiescence to their
plans. Gorbachev had refused. He had known that the KGB and the military
had been preparing plans to crack down on unrest in the republics, but
had never thought they would act against him. With Gorbachev's refusal,
the plotters' plans started to go awry even before they had been
announced. In the late afternoon on the day of the coup, the commander
of a tank battalion sent to disperse the crowds in front of the Russian
parliament declared his loyalty to the Russian Republic. Yeltsin climbed
on top of one of the tanks and denounced the takeover. "We are dealing
with a rightist, reactionary, anti-constitutional coup," Yeltsin
shouted. "Such methods of force are unacceptable. They... return us to
the Cold War era along with the Soviet Union's isolation in the world
community.... I call on all Russians to give a dignified answer to the
putschists and demand that the country be returned to normal
constitutional
order."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en626en">^42^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en626} It was
his finest hour. Some of his aides commented, not incorrectly, that it
was the role Yeltsin was born to play.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-612}From then on everything went wrong for the
coup-makers. The Moscow curfew they tried to impose was not observed.
More and more barricades went up in the capital. Military units were
reluctant to follow orders. The KGB hesitated. Leaders in the republics
did not return their calls. From inside the Russian parliament---the
Belyi Dom, or White House, as it was called in Russian---Boris Yeltsin
organized the resistance. He announced the setting up of Russian, as
distinct from Soviet, armed forces and appointed himself commander in
chief. On the third day the members of the government committee simply
gave up. Some flew to the Crimea to meet with Gorbachev, who greeted
them with ice-cold contempt. Others simply slunk away and were later
arrested by the police. Boris Pugo, the interior minister, and his wife
committed suicide, as did Gorbachev's chief military aide, Marshal
Sergei Akhromeev, who had offered his services to the committee.</p>
<p>Gorbachev flew back to Moscow on a plane sent by the Russian leaders.
His mood was grim. His wife, Raisa, his closest friend and ally, had
collapsed during their incarceration, suffering from hypertension. He
thought about all those whom he had appointed to high office who had
betrayed him. On arrival he went home to make sure Raisa was properly
looked after. It was a very human thing to do, but it was a dreadful
political mistake. It disappointed his supporters who had put their
lives on the line for him, and allowed Yeltsin to take political control
of Moscow. The Russian president worked through the night. When
Gorbachev reported for duty the next day, Russia was already taking over
the USSR.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-613}Yeltsin's first order was to suspend all
activities of the CPSU on Russian territory. Party offices were closed
and the Central Committee building in Moscow sealed. Its archives and
documents were taken over by Yeltsin loyalists. The head of the KGB,
Vladimir Kriuchkov, who had been among the coup-plotters, was arrested
and the KGB was later dissolved. Hundreds of KGB officers inside the
headquarters at Lubianka first thought the angry crowds would storm the
building. Instead Muscovites were diverted by the sight of cranes,
ordered there by Yeltsin, dismembering the statue of Feliks
Dzherzhinskii, the founder of the secret police, in the square outside.
In the Kremlin Yeltsin forced Gorbachev to rescind his appointments of
new heads of the Soviet military and the security service, and appoint
officers close to Yeltsin instead. When Gorbachev appeared before the
Russian parliament to thank them for their fortitude, he was heckled by
the representatives and openly mocked by Yeltsin, who signed further
orders to outlaw CPSU activities in the general secretary's presence.
When Gorbachev claimed, from the rostrum, that he could not determine
the full extent of the CPSU's culpability in the coup because he had not
yet read the relevant documents, Yeltsin walked across the podium with
transcripts from party meetings. "Read this!" said the Russian
president, and forced Gorbachev to read out to the assembly evidence of
how his Communist colleagues had betrayed
him.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en627en">^43^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en627} Power was
palpably shifting in the USSR.</p>
<p>The final drama of the Cold War became a purely Soviet tragedy. As
Yeltsin worked with other leaders in the republics to set up a new
commonwealth of sovereign states, bypassing the USSR entirely,
Gorbachev's power waned. After the coup, he resigned as general
secretary and did not challenge Yeltsin's wholesale expropriation of the
CPSU's funds and properties in Russia. In September 1991 the Congress of
People's Deputies, the elected union assembly Gorbachev had invested so
much faith in as a new democratic parliament of the USSR, dissolved
itself. Politics in the republics was taking precedence, also for the
politicians. The Baltic states had already reestablished themselves as
fully independent countries during the August coup. In the Central Asian
republics, so unwilling to see the Soviet Union go in March, national
elites coming out of the Communist Party declared full sovereignty
during the autumn of 1991. Their situation was similar to the effects of
British or French decolonization thirty years earlier: the imperial
center gave up ruling, and therefore local elites set up new states
based, in main part, on lessons learned during the late imperial era.
The last nail in the Soviet coffin was the 1 December referendum in
Ukraine, in which the population voted overwhelmingly for full
independence.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-614}Throughout all of this Gorbachev could
have tried to use force to keep the union together. He was still the
president of the USSR. He himself believed that the Red Army would have
obeyed him, as would, at least up to a point, the security services. But
he steadfastly refused to do so. To him, an involuntary union was no
alternative to a Soviet Union. He repeatedly told his diminishing group
of advisers---now again mainly his old liberal friends---that using
force would endanger everything they had stood for. He would not preside
over a dictatorship; he would rather see the union disappear and be
replaced by some form of confederation, as Gorbachev believed was
Yeltsin's aim. Maybe it could prevent the USSR turning into another
Yugoslavia, where civil wars were now already raging. Also, Gorbachev
was exhausted. After the betrayal by people to whom he had been close,
and with his beloved wife ill, even he did not have the strength to
fight on.</p>
<p>On 8 December 1991 the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met
secretly at a government guest house in the Belavezha Forest near the
Polish-Belorussian border. They met there because all of them still
feared that the security services, on Gorbachev's orders, would show up
to arrest them. In the document they hastily signed, the Soviet Union
was dissolved in a subclause, in which the three simply ascertained
"that the USSR as a subject of international law and a geopolitical
reality no longer exists." Instead they set up a Commonwealth of
Independent States, which other Soviet republics could join at will.
They pledged to cooperate politically and economically, to extend the
same rights to everyone residing in their respective republics,
irrespective of their national origin, and to fully respect the
territorial integrity of each other and of all
countries.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en628en">^44^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en628}
Russia ratified the treaty on 12 December, the same day as it withdrew
from the Soviet Union. Within weeks Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan had all
joined the new commonwealth.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-615}After some last-minute hesitation,
Gorbachev decided to resign as Soviet president. In a televised
resignation speech to the Soviet people in the evening on 25 December,
the president said that he had fought for "the preservation of the union
state and the integrity of this country." But</p>
<p>::: blockquote
developments took a different course. The policy prevailed of
dismembering this country and disuniting the state, which is something I
cannot subscribe to.... Destiny so ruled that when I found myself at the
helm of this state it already was clear that something was wrong....
[It] was going nowhere and we could not possibly live the way we did.
We had to change everything radically.... An effort of historical
importance has been carried out. The totalitarian system has been
eliminated, which prevented this country from becoming a prosperous and
well-to-do country a long time ago.... I am positive that sooner or
later, some day, our common efforts will bear fruit and our nations will
live in a prosperous, democratic society. I wish everyone all the
best.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en629en">^45^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en629}
:::</p>
<p>Before broadcasting his speech, Gorbachev had called President Bush and
explained what would happen. Soviet nuclear weapons were safe, he told
him. Authority would be transferred to Yeltsin immediately. His usual
noncommittal self, Bush responded to Gorbachev's emotional Christmas Day
call by speaking in generalities, as if to a public meeting: "And so, at
this time of year and at this historic time, we salute you and thank you
for what you have done for world peace. Thank you very
much."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en630en">^46^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en630}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter022.xhtml#page-616}As Gorbachev finished his televised
address, his military aides carrying the suitcases with the nuclear
codes stole quietly away, looking for their new boss in another part of
the Kremlin. Gorbachev went alone to the Walnut Room, where members of
the Soviet Politburo had often met, for a drink with five of his closest
aides. Then, before midnight, he went home, as ex-president of a former
country.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en631en">^47^</a>{#chapter022.xhtml#en631}</p>
<p><strong>T[HE DISSOLUTION OF]{.small-caps}</strong> the Soviet Union removed the last
vestige of the Cold War as an international system. For two generations
it had dominated international affairs, and the ideological struggle
that preceded it and on which it fed had lasted even longer. As in most
great changes in world politics, the end was sudden but the antecedents
were long. As a dominant aspect in human affairs, the Cold War had ailed
for some time, at least since profound global economic and political
changes began in the mid-1970s. But the Soviet collapse brought it to a
definite conclusion. There was no country left to challenge the United
States globally in the name of a radically different ideology. Conflicts
and tensions that had grown from the Cold War would remain, as would its
nightmarish weapons and curbed strategies, but time had moved on, and
new forms of global interaction had taken the place of the old.

<p>As an international system of states, the Cold War ended on that cold
and gray December day in Moscow when Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Soviet
Union out of existence. But the ideological Cold War, which predated
this state system by almost two generations, disappeared only in part.
Granted, Communism in its Marxist-Leninist form had ceased to exist as a
practical ideal for how to organize society. But on the US side, not so
much changed on that day in December 1991. American foreign policy
rolled on, unperturbed by any significant adjustments in strategic
vision or political aims. The Cold War was over, and the United States
had won it. But most Americans still believed that they could only be
safe if the world looked significantly more like their own country and
if the world's governments abided by the will of the United States. By
almost every measure, the ideas and assumptions built up over
generations stayed wholly unreformed, despite the disappearance of a
major external threat. Instead of a more limited and therefore
achievable US foreign policy, the majority of policy-makers from either
party believed this was a unipolar moment, where the United States
could, at minimal cost, act on its urges.</p>
<p>US post--Cold War triumphalism came in two versions. One could be called
the Clinton version, which emphasized US-style capitalist prosperity and
market values on a global scale. Its lack of specific purpose in
international affairs was striking, as was its lack of discipline in
achieving even its economic aims. Instead of building broad and stable
frameworks for the conduct of US foreign policy, through the UN, the
international monetary institutions, and long-term agreements with other
Great Powers (in general China and Russia), the Clinton Administration
concentrated on its prosperity agenda. Its political instincts in doing
so, at home at least, were probably right: Americans were tired of the
international campaigns of the past and wanted to enjoy what some called
"the peace dividend." But internationally the 1990s was a lost
opportunity for institutionalizing cooperation, as it was for using the
peace dividend globally to combat disease, poverty, and inequality. The
most glaring examples of these omissions were former Cold War
battlefields like Afghanistan, Congo, or Nicaragua, where the United
States---or most others for that matter---could not have cared less
about what happened immediately after the Cold War was over.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-618}The second form of US post--Cold War
triumphalism could be called the Bush version. Where Clinton emphasized
prosperity, Bush emphasized predominance. In between, of course, stands
9/11. It is possible that the Bush version would never have come into
being if it were not for the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington carried out by Islamist fanatics---in fact by a renegade
faction of one of the US Cold War alliances. What is clear is that the
Cold War experience conditioned the response of the United States to
these atrocities. Instead of a combination of targeted military strikes
and global police cooperation, which would have been the most sensible
reaction, the Bush Administration chose to use the unipolar moment to
lash out at its enemies and occupy Afghanistan and Iraq. These actions
had no meaning in a strategic sense, in effect creating two
twenty-first-century colonies under the rule of a Great Power with no
appetite for or interest in colonial rule. Most independent observers
with any experience of the two countries told Washington that the
occupations would lead to more Islamist activity, not less. But the
United States did not act out of strategic purpose. It acted because its
people, understandably, were angry and fearful. And it acted because it
could. The direction of the actions were decided by Bush's foreign
policy advisers, people like Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul
Wolfowitz, who all thought of the world mainly in Cold War terms. They
stressed power projection, territorial control, and regime change, in
cases where the combination of regional alliance-building, strict
economic embargos, international policing, and punitive air strikes
would have done the job more effectively.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-619}Put together, the 1990s and 2000s were as
if the United States had lost a global purpose---the Cold War---and not
yet found a new one. In the meantime, old habits and ways of thinking
remained in place, more or less unchanged. There are those, of course,
who would insist that the United States cannot behave internationally in
any other manner. Because of its distinctly ideological character as a
nation, founded on values and political principles rather than on a long
heritage of common culture and language, it is in itself a kind of
permanent Cold War against all opponents. The United States cannot get a
Gorbachev moment of introspection and doubt, it is claimed, because such
questioning of the purpose of the nation would go against the very being
of America. The post--Cold War era was therefore not an aberration but a
confirmation of an absolute historical purpose for the United States, in
which the Cold War was just one episode and where global hegemony or
defeat are the only two possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Those who claim such consistency in the international role of the United
States are almost certainly wrong. Its foreign policies have, after all,
shifted over time, dependent on domestic concepts of political purpose,
military capabilities, and actual foreign threats. It could be argued,
and I would agree, that the democratic promise of the United
States---unfulfilled as it has often been---negates such a determinism.
But the lack of self-reflection and specific debate, which Cold War
triumphalism gave rise to, meant that necessary changes in policy after
the Cold War were more difficult to carry out. Such a view is not
arguing against the long-term significance of ideology in US foreign
policy, which I have written about at great length in this book and
elsewhere. But it is to see US post--Cold War rudderlessness as a
consequence of a lack of imaginative leadership, not as something
essential or predetermined.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-620}Some people would say that asking for a
post--Cold War reorientation of US foreign policy was asking too much,
and that critiques of triumphalism are too easy. The United States,
after all, won the Cold War, and therefore would have little demand for
altering its course. The USSR needed Gorbachev's reforms, and collapsed
when they failed. But the United States had no use for such wholesale
changes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>
<p>But such a position takes far too narrow a view of the US Cold War
experience. Like its enemy, the United States had its portion of Cold
War successes and failures. It is just that the balance sheet came out
differently, and better, than that of the other side. Post--Cold War
mythologies, often employed, for instance, with regard to Iraq and
Afghanistan, and, I am sure, other conflicts in the future, stress
Reagan's military buildup and willingness to confront the USSR as the
root cause of the US Cold War victory. This book has stressed, even (or
maybe especially) for the Reagan era, long-term alliances, technological
advances, economic growth, and the willingness to negotiate as more
important weapons in the US arsenal. Whatever direction the thinking
goes in, it is clear that the United States failed to use the better
lessons of how it conducted the Cold War in order to get a grip on its
role in the post--Cold War era.</p>
<p>This book has shown that the main reason the Cold War ended was that the
world as a whole was changing. From the 1970s on, global economic
transformations were taking place, which first privileged the United
States but then provided increasing advantages for China and other Asian
countries. Gradually, over the course of the generation that has passed
since the Cold War, the United States can less and less afford global
predominance. Increasingly, it has to position itself to work with
others within a multipolar constellation of states. The self-indulgence
of the 1990s and the failed attempts at rearranging the Islamic world by
force of the 2000s meant that the United States squandered many chances
to prepare for a new century in which its relative power will be
reduced. Lessons from the Cold War indicate that its main aim should
have been to tie others into the kinds of principles for international
behavior that the United States would like to see long term, especially
as its own power diminishes.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-621}Instead the United States did what
declining Superpowers often do: engage in futile, needless wars far from
its borders, in which short-term security (or even convenience) is
mistaken for long-term strategic goals. The US preoccupation with
absolute security (which cannot be had) and cheap oil, which was, at
best, a limited fix, led it to disregard the broader picture, especially
as far as Asia was concerned. The consequence is a United States that is
less prepared than it could have been to deal with the big challenges of
the future: the rise of China and India, the transfer of economic power
from West to East, or systemic tests such as climate change and
epidemics.</p>
<p>If the United States won the Cold War, as I think it did, then the
Soviet Union, or rather Russia, lost it, and lost it big. The main
reason this happened was that its political leaders, in the Communist
Party, did not give its own population a political, economic, or social
system that was fit for purpose. The Soviet peoples had sacrificed
immensely during the twentieth century in an attempt at building a state
and society of which they could be proud. The vast majority of citizens
had believed that their hard work and defense of their achievements had
created both a Superpower with a global reach and a better future for
themselves. The ability to believe in improvement under Soviet rule,
which would also be the pinnacle of Russian achievement, kept doubts
away for the majority, even for those who ought to have known better.
The crimes of the Soviet state were ignored by rulers and ruled alike,
in a mutual conspiracy of silence.</p>
<p>Then, in the 1980s, it all came crashing down. Conditions at home got
worse, not better. The state, which many had thought to be near
omnipotent, failed at carrying out even the simplest tasks. Afghanistan
and the cost of international isolation deprived the young of the future
they wanted. And when necessary reform set in under Gorbachev, it too
failed to deliver the progress that citizens craved. Although many
Soviets embraced the freedom to speak openly, to vote, to form
organizations, to practice their religion, or to watch films and read
literature that had been banned, there was a gaping hole at the core of
Gorbachev's perestroika. Without bread, what freedom?, some of them
asked, increasingly
often.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en632en">^1^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en632}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-622}And then the Communist Party
self-destructed and the Soviet government suddenly was no more. With the
exception of the Baltic states, independence came to the Soviet
republics not as a preexisting demand from below, but more as an effect
of the ongoing Soviet collapse. After December 1991 fifteen republics,
all former parts of the USSR, suddenly had to find their own way in the
world. Nationalism came to most of them as a justification for national
independence, not the other way around. In that way the collapse of the
Soviet Union was indeed a case of decolonization, reminiscent of what
had happened to the British or French empires. No wonder that almost all
of the post-Soviet states struggle with high levels of ethnic and
political tension even after a generation of sovereignty.</p>
<p>It was worst for Russia itself. The collapse left Russians feeling
<em>déclassée</em>, robbed of their position, whether they lived in Russia
itself or were among the many who inhabited other new post-Soviet
states. One day they had been the elite in a Superpower. The next they
had neither purpose nor position. Materially things were bad, too. Old
people did not get their pensions. Some starved to death. Malnutrition
and alcoholism reduced the average life span for a Russian man from
sixty-six in 1985 to less than fifty-eight ten years later. To Russians
used to a remarkable degree of (sometimes depressing) stability, theft,
violence, and pornographic movies seemed to be the greatest achievements
of post-Soviet freedom.</p>
<p>Among the thefts was one that will safely qualify as the raid of the
century. This was the privatization of Russian industry and of its
natural resources. Privatization had to come, some of its defenders say.
After the USSR collapsed, its planned economy was moribund. But even if
one accepts this argument, the way privatization happened was
indefensible. As the socialist state was being dismantled, ownership of
Russia's riches was taken over by a new oligarchy emerging from party
institutions, planning bureaus, and centers of science and technology.
Instead of being used to cure some of the country's many ills, resources
were given away to the well-connected, especially among the friends and
supporters of President Boris Yeltsin. Value created by generations was
transferred to individuals who had no connection with the local
community (but plenty of connections with those in power). Very often
the new owners stripped their possessions of what they could sell and
closed down whatever production was left. Unemployment rose from zero to
30 percent within three years. And all this happened while the West
applauded Yeltsin's economic reform.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-623}In hindsight, at least, it is clear that
the economic transition to capitalism was a catastrophe for most
Russians. It is also clear that the West should have dealt with
post--Cold War Russia better than it did. It is hard, however, to
specify what alternative paths would have looked like. The key, I think,
would have been the realization, so often lacking in the 1990s, that
Russia would under all circumstances remain a crucial state in any
international system because of its sheer size. It would therefore have
been in the interest of the West, and especially the Europeans, to begin
integrating the country into European security and trade arrangements as
soon as possible after 1991. Such an approach would have demanded a lot
of money and even more patience, given the chaos that reigned in Russia.
Some argue that it would have been politically impossible, both within
the West and within Russia itself. An effort the size of the Marshall
Plan was certainly not in the offing. But both the West and Russia would
have been considerably more secure today if the chance for Russia to
join the European Union and possibly also NATO in some form had at least
been kept open in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Instead Russia was kept out of the processes of military and economic
integration that eventually extended all the way to its borders. It has
given Russians the sense of being outcasts and has left the country
sulking at Europe's door. In turn, this has given credence to Russian
jingoists and bigots, such as its current president Vladimir Putin, who
see all the disasters that have befallen the country over the past
generation as part of some preconceived US plan to reduce and isolate
it. Putin's authoritarianism and bellicosity have been sustained by
genuine popular support. Most Russians would like to believe that all
that has happened to them is someone else's fault, instead of dealing
with the immense problems in Russian society and in the Russian state
themselves. The shocks of the 1990s have given way to a peculiar Russian
form of uninhibited cynicism, which not only encompasses a deep distrust
of their fellow citizens, but sees long-term, effective conspiracies
against themselves everywhere in the world, often contrary to fact and
reason. Over half of all Russians now believe Leonid Brezhnev was their
best leader in the twentieth century, followed by Lenin and Stalin.
Gorbachev is at the bottom of the
list.<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en633en">^2^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en633}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-624}For others around the world, the end of
the Cold War undoubtedly came as a relief. With the threat of global
nuclear annihilation gone, one of the big challenges to human existence
had been removed, or at least suspended. There was also reason to hope,
especially during the 1990s, that Great Power interventionism would be
reduced, and that principles of sovereignty and self-determination would
be respected. Europe and Japan had gained much from the Cold War itself,
as had China in its latter phase. The division of Europe, and of
Germany, had been a tragedy, as had the imposition of dictatorial
regimes in the East. But the international system had given Europe
almost fifty years of peace, unknown there during the first part of the
century. And protected by that peace, resilient societies had grown up
that were able to handle post--Cold War transformations remarkably well,
including the unsparing transition to capitalism in the East and the
unification of Germany, the biggest single project of the post--Cold War
era. Japan, shorn of the distinct international economic advantages that
the Cold War era had bestowed upon it, entered a period of low growth.
But it did so from a very high level of development, which in 1995 saw
the country's GDP per capita still stand at more than 30 percent above
that of the United States. "If this is a recession," commented an
African friend of mine, living in Tokyo, "we want one, too!"</p>
<p>China is often seen as one of the main beneficiaries of the Cold War.
This is not entirely true, of course. The country saw imposed on it a
European-style Marxist-Leninist dictatorship that was mostly out of tune
with its needs. The result, during the Maoist era, were some of the most
terrible crimes of the Cold War, in which millions died. But during the
1970s and 1980s, Deng Xiaoping's China benefitted massively from its de
facto alliance with the United States both in terms of security and
development programs. The end of the Cold War came as a complete shock
to the Chinese leaders, who suddenly realized that they---in part due to
their own efforts combatting the Soviets---would be left to face the
Americans in a unipolar world. From the Chinese perspective the wrong
Superpower collapsed: they had believed that, at least long-term, the
USSR was in ascendance, while the United States was declining. From the
1990s on, the Chinese Communist Party was terrified that US influence
would subvert its rule at home and hem it in abroad, including among its
Asian neighbors.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-625}In the multipolar world that is now
establishing itself, it seems likely that the United States and China
will be the strongest powers. Unless they stumble at home, and both may
easily do so, their competition for influence in Asia will define the
outlook for the world. But the US relationship with China, or with
Russia for that matter, is unlikely to develop into any form of Cold
War. Both have political systems very different from the United States
(or from each other). But both China and Russia are well integrated into
the capitalist world system, and many of their leaders' interests are
linked to further integration. Unlike the USSR, these people are not
likely to seek isolation or global confrontation. They will attempt to
nibble away at US interests and dominate within their regions. But
neither are, by themselves, willing or capable to institute global
ideological conflict or militarized alliance systems. Rivalries, most
certainly, which may lead to conflicts or even localized wars, but not
of the Cold War kind.</p>
<p>Throughout the Cold War, it was the battleground regions that suffered
most. Korea, Indochina, Afghanistan, much of Africa and Central America
were left devastated. Some recovered, but for others devastation left
cynicism in its wake. US Cold War clients may have been best at sheer
plunder. Just dictators whose names start with the letter M---Mobutu
(Congo), Marcos (Philippines), and Mubarak (Egypt)---among them amassed
fortunes of an estimated \$17 billion, according to recent estimates.
But Soviet clients were not far behind. Angola, one of the countries
most ravaged by the Cold War, could have been among the wealthiest parts
of the world due to its mineral and energy resources. But today most of
its population remain desperately poor. Meanwhile, the daughter of the
president is reported to be the richest woman in Africa. Her net fortune
is estimated at around \$3 billion.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-626}The ease with which many former Marxists
adapted themselves to a post--Cold War market system begs the question
whether this had been an avoidable conflict in the first place. What is
clear is that the outcome was not worth the sacrifice, not in Angola,
but probably not in Vietnam, Nicaragua, or for that matter Russia
either. "If I had to do it over again," confessed Bulgaria's long-time
Communist boss Todor Zhivkov, "I would not even be a Communist, and if
Lenin were alive today he would say the same thing.... I must now admit
that we started from the wrong basis, from the wrong premise. The
foundation of socialism was wrong. I believe that at its very conception
the idea of socialism was
stillborn."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en634en">^3^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en634} Even
among those who were on the winning side the costs and risks have
sometimes seemed too high: in lives, in expenditure, and in the threat
of nuclear war.</p>
<p>But was it avoidable back in the 1940s, when the Cold War went from an
ideological conflict to a permanent military confrontation? While
post--World War II clashes and rivalries were certainly
unavoidable---Stalin's policies alone were enough to produce those---it
is hard to argue that a global Cold War that was to last for almost
fifty years and threaten the obliteration of the world could not in any
form have been avoided. There were points along the way when leaders
could have held back, especially on military rivalry and the arms race.
But the ideological conflict that was at the bottom of the post--World
War II tension made such sensible thinking very difficult to achieve. In
that sense, it was its ideological origins that made the Cold War
special and hyperdangerous. People of goodwill on both sides believed
that they were representing an idea whose very existence was threatened.
It led them to take otherwise avoidable risks with their own lives and
the lives of others.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-627}Another big question is whether the Cold
War actually was, as one key book title has it, "the division of the
world."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en635en">^4^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en635} Some
argue that state leaders (and historians) were too blinded by the Cold
War as an organizing principle for a period of history to see the
diversity and hybridity that went on beside it. This book has argued
that although the Cold War between capitalism and socialism influenced
most things in the twentieth century, it did not decide everything. The
two world wars, the Great Depression, decolonization, and the transfer
of wealth and power from West to East may well have happened even
without the Cold War (but obviously not in the form that they eventually
got). Likewise, some polities refused to take part, at least fully.
India, for instance, was in many ways established as an anti--Cold War
state. Others had systems that allowed for significant levels of state
control while remaining capitalist in essence, such as in Scandinavia.
Capitalist Norway has more state ownership of companies than socialist
China. And, percentage-wise, Sweden's government spends two times more
than China's out of the country's total GDP.</p>
<p>And yet the Cold War did influence most things because of the centrality
of its ideologies and the intensity of its adherents. A number of
countries and movements went to war against US-led capitalism in the
twentieth century. By 1945 they had been defeated, Germany and Japan
first among them. Sitting in his bunker in Berlin in 1945, just before
killing himself, even Hitler admitted that in the future "there will
remain in the world only two Great Powers capable of confronting each
other---the United States and Soviet
Russia."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en636en">^5^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en636} The
reason why this was so clear to everyone was not just the strategic
capabilities of the two states. It was also because each symbolized a
distinct way of organizing society and the state. The United States was
in 1945 and throughout the Cold War the more powerful of the two. But
the USSR was on most counts a credible challenge right up to the end.</p>
<p>The most important reason why the Cold War affected everyone in the
world was the threat of nuclear destruction that it implied. In this
sense, nobody was safe from the Cold War. The greatest victory of
Gorbachev's generation was that nuclear war was avoided. Historically,
most Great Power rivalries end in a cataclysm. The Cold War did not
(which is the reason why I can write about these events now from the
relative safety of my Harvard study). Even so, there is no doubt that
the nuclear arms race was profoundly dangerous. On a couple of
occasions, we were much closer to nuclear devastation than anyone but a
few people realized. Nuclear war could have broken out by accident, or
as a result of intelligence failures. When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1985, the organization International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War outlined the medical consequences: "A horror-stricken and
dust-covered Earth, burned bodies of the dead and wounded, and people
slowly dying of radiation
disease."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en637en">^6^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en637} Or, in
pop culture, Depeche Mode sang about the two-minute warning before
destruction and of the world afterward: "The dawning of another year...
one in four still
here."<a href="#endnotes.xhtml#en638en">^7^</a>{#chapter023.xhtml#en638}</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-628}Why were leaders willing to take such
unconscionable risks with the fate of the earth? Why did so many people
believe in ideologies which the same people at other times would have
realized could not hold all the solutions they were looking for? The
answer, I think, is that the Cold War world, like the world today,
obviously had a lot of ills. As injustice and oppression became more
visible in the twentieth century, people---and especially young
people---felt the need to remedy these ills. Cold War ideologies offered
immediate solutions to complex problems. For most, it was a bit like
buying a car (which I happen to be doing at the moment). In my heart, I
would like a bit of Volvo, and a bit of Ford, and a bit of Toyota. But I
cannot have that, since manufacturers refuse to sell their new cars in
parts. And, even if they did, I am not an expert mechanic. Though I
trust (or at least hope) that the automakers' mechanics are top-notch.
The Cold War was a bit like that. Most people had to take what was
available, even if it conflicted with specific needs or even with common
sense.</p>
<p>What did not change with the end of the Cold War were the conflicts
between the haves and the have-nots in international affairs. Now in
some parts of the world such conflicts are made more intense by the
upsurge of religious and ethnic movements, which threaten to destroy
whole communities. Unrestrained by Cold War universalisms, which at
least pretended that all people could enter their promised paradise,
these groups are palpably exclusionist or racist. Some, in the Middle
East, Europe, south Asia, or in the United States, remind us a bit about
what the world was like before the Cold War became an international
system. Stakes are higher now, not least because of weapons of mass
destruction. And solutions are even more difficult to find, though most
realize that at some point negotiations and compromise will have to come
into play. But compromise is hard, because supporters of these groups or
states believe that great injustices have been done to them in the past,
which somehow justify their present outrages.</p>
<p>[]{#chapter023.xhtml#page-629}Before, during, and after the Cold War,
everyone wants their place in the sun. A chance to be counted. Respect
for what they consider as theirs, whether in religion, lifestyle, or
territory. Often people, and especially young people, need to be part of
something bigger than themselves or even their families, some immense
idea to devote one's life to. The Cold War shows what happens when such
notions get perverted for the sake of power, influence, and control. But
that does not mean that these very human urges are in themselves
worthless. On the contrary, if the plan had been to heal the sick,
abolish poverty, or give everyone a chance in life <em>without</em> threatening
the world with nuclear annihilation, then we would probably have summed
up much of the efforts that went into the Cold War as good. History is
complex. We do not always know where ideas will lead us. Better, then,
to consider carefully the risks we are willing to take to achieve good
results, in order not to replicate the terrible toll that the twentieth
century took in its search for perfection.

<p>Writing world history is never easy, even when the focus is on a set of
events that are limited in time and effect. Although the author is of
course responsible for the conclusions, the work is necessarily
dependent on the research of those who know infinitely more about parts
of the story than any one person can aspire to investigate in a
lifetime. World history is therefore always a collective enterprise,
implicitly or explicitly. Anyone who believes that they alone can be the
judge of all the detail in big history are fools. But likewise, those
experts who think that big history cannot or should not be done are
poorer for it. They limit their own understanding, just like they limit
the uses of history for potential readers.</p>
<p>For me, that usefulness is key to what I do. It can of course be
achieved through many kinds of history writing, big and small, broad and
narrow, with different focus points in terms of individuals,
communities, states, or social classes. But world history, like its
cousins international and transnational history, has a particular
significance because it allows the historian and the reader to put
things into context beyond individual countries or even regions. This is
what I strive to do in this book: to tell the history of the global Cold
War on all continents and within a broad chronology, in ways that make
plain the differences in how groups of people experienced the conflict.
It has been a difficult task and it is now up to the readers to judge
how well it is done.</p>
<p><strong>I [HAVE TALLIED]{.small-caps}</strong> up a great amount of intellectual
debts during the time it has taken me to write this book. My first debt,
as always, is to my teachers and mentors: Michael Hunt in Chapel Hill,
Geir Lundestad and Helge Pharo in Oslo, and Mick Cox in London. My
colleagues at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)
and at Harvard have helped develop different aspects of the book
(sometimes in ways that are not easy to recognize). I am particularly
grateful to the extraordinary group of people who, together with Mick
and myself, created LSE IDEAS: Svetozar Rajak, Emilia Knight, Tiha
Franulovic, Gordon Barrass, and many, many others. Working in IDEAS was
one of the highlights of my academic career, not least because the study
of the Cold War as an international system is an IDEAS mainstay. In the
Department of International History at LSE most of my colleagues had
some input to this book, especially Piers Ludlow, Tanya Harmer, Antony
Best, Vladislav Zubok, Kirsten Schulze, Nigel Ashton, MacGregor Knox,
David Stevenson, Steven Casey, Kristina Spohr, Gagan Sood, and Roham
Alvandi.</p>
<p>[]{#acknowledgements.xhtml#page-632}Much of my understanding of the Cold
War has come through two extraordinary projects that I have been lucky
enough to be part of. One was the setting up of the journal <em>Cold War
History</em>, in publication since 2000. I have learned much from all the
members of the editorial board and from generations of managing editors
who have done an outstanding job in establishing the journal. I have
also, of course, learned much from the contributors (including some of
those who in the end did not get published!). The late Saki Dockrill
drove the journal forward. I cherish her memory.</p>
<p>I was also very lucky to co-edit the massive <em>Cambridge History of the
Cold War</em> with Melvyn Leffler. Working with the seventy-plus authors was
an intense learning experience, both (I must confess) with regard to
knowledge and patience. Working with Mel as co-editor was a joy
throughout. He is one of my favorite colleagues: erudite, meticulous,
and always supportive.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to the many students at LSE and now at Harvard who
have joined in my classes on the Cold War. Learning is always a two-way
street. A lot of the insights that have helped create this book have
come to me by way of undergraduate or graduate students during lively
discussions in class, or through the supervision of PhD students. I am
among those who find it difficult to write without teaching: being in
the classroom is a way of testing out ideas, frameworks, and structure,
which benefits most things that I do, this book not least.</p>
<p>[]{#acknowledgements.xhtml#page-633}During my time at LSE IDEAS I was
lucky enough (thanks to the generosity of Emmanuel Roman) to link up
with a remarkable array of visiting professors who all had an impact on
how this book was written: Paul Kennedy (more than anyone), Chen Jian,
Gilles Kepel, Niall Ferguson, Ramachandra Guha, Anne Applebaum, and
Matthew Connelly.</p>
<p>My new colleagues at Harvard have been very helpful in the final stages
of the process. Tony Saich and the Ash Center at the Harvard Kennedy
School have provided a congenial and creative atmosphere in which to
work. Even before I myself moved to Harvard in 2015, I drew on the
remarkable knowledge and insights of Mark Kramer and his Cold War
project here.</p>
<p>I have benefitted enormously from the help of colleagues around the
world who have facilitated my research, often putting their own work
aside to help me during my visits. I am especially grateful to Niu Jun,
Zhang Baijia, and Niu Ke in Beijing, Alexander Chubarian and Vladimir
Pechatnov in Moscow, Silvio Pons in Rome, Jordan Baev in Sofia, Nguyen
Vu Tung in Hanoi, Ljubodrag Dimić and Miladin Milošević in Belgrade,
Srinath Raghavan in Delhi, Khaled Fahmy in Cairo, and Matias Spektor in
Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>A number of colleagues and friends have been kind enough to read and
comment on parts of the manuscript as it was being created. They have
helped me make it a better book and avoid (I hope) too many mistakes in
the text. I am very much indebted to Vladislav Zubok, Serhii Plokhy,
Csaba Békés, Stephen Walt, Christopher Goscha, Chen Jian, Piers Ludlow,
Fred Logevall, Mary Sarotte, Daniel Sargent, Vanni Pettinà, Anton
Harder, David Engerman, Niu Jun, Mark Kramer, Sulmaan Khan, Tanya
Harmer, and Tarek Masoud.</p>
<p>I have been helped by fantastic research assistants for parts of this
project. I am grateful to Sandeep Bhardwaj (in Delhi), Khadiga Omar (in
Cairo), and Maria Terzieva (in Sofia). The latter two also helped with
translations, as did Laszlo Horvath (Hungarian) and Jan Cornelius
(Afrikaans). Trung Chi Tran helped at Harvard during the final stages.
The research for the Korean part of the book received a generous grant
from the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2010-DZZ-3104).</p>
<p>[]{#acknowledgements.xhtml#page-634}When most needed, friends provided
wonderful locations in which to write: Sue and Mike Potts in St. Marcel,
Cathie and Enrique Pani in Mexico, and Hina and Nilesh Patel in Norfolk.
I am very grateful to them.</p>
<p>One of the fun things about working on the global history of the Cold
War over the past twenty years has been that so much work is
collaborative. This is not least due to two remarkable institutions in
Washington, DC: the Cold War International History Project at the
Woodrow Wilson Center and the National Security Archive. I, and
countless other historians, have benefitted enormously from the help and
diligence of these two institutions, which have done so much to make US
and foreign documents on the Cold War available to the public. I am
particularly grateful to Christian Ostermann and (before him) James
Hershberg at the Wilson Center, and to Thomas Blanton, Malcolm Byrne,
and Svetlana Savranskaya at the archive.</p>
<p>My literary agent, Sarah Chalfant of the Wylie Agency, has made this
book happen in more ways than I think she herself realizes. In the
latter stages of production, I have been extraordinarily lucky to work
with two terrific publishers, Lara Heimert at Basic Books in New York
and Simon Winder at Penguin in London. Bill Warhop has done an expert
job with the copyediting.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been truly blessed to have worked with outstanding
administrative assistants throughout the research for this book. Tiha
Franulovic at LSE was the bedrock of my professional existence for more
than a decade. At Harvard, first Lia Tjahjana and now Samantha Gammons
have assisted with ability and dedication. They are the facilitators on
whom scholars depend to get things done.</p>
<p><strong>L[ET ME END]{.small-caps}</strong> with a few remarks on conventions and
approaches throughout the book. In the endnotes, I have aimed at
simplicity and precision. I had to avoid making an overlong book even
longer through massive amounts of archival citations, but also to make
it possible for other scholars to retrieve documents where I have found
them. Materials I have had access to in archives are cited by their
original archival location. Documents I have had access to through other
depositories, such as library collections, CWIHP, the National Security
Archive, or other online sites, have been cited with their current
(November 2016) physical or online location.</p>
<p>[]{#acknowledgements.xhtml#page-635}Translations from original sources
are my own, except when noted. I have, however, on occasion consulted
other translations or sought the help of native speakers to improve
accuracy and readability.</p>
<p>I have not always been able to give enough credit where credit is due to
those many who have assembled, edited, or translated collections of
documents. These are the workers upon whom everyone else in this
business depend. I myself have been among their number, so I know.
Again, my weak excuse is that I could not make this book even lengthier.
So, that said, let me express my allegiance and gratitude to those many,
whether in Washington, or Beijing, or Moscow, who are working hard and

Communist Antonio Gramsci in 1934, is ultimately an American challenge
to Europe. "Europe wants to have its cake and eat it, to have all the
benefits which Fordism brings to its competitive power while retaining
its army of [social] parasites who, by consuming vast sums of surplus
value, aggravate initial costs and reduce competitive power on the
international market." David Forgacs, ed., <em>The Gramsci Reader: Selected
